nm0000092,John Cleese,John Marwood Cleese,196,John Cleese was born on October 27  1939  in Weston-Super-Mare  England  to Muriel Evelyn (Cross) and Reginald Francis Cleese. He was born into a family of modest means  his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height  having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve  and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself  collected jokes  and  like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians  was devoted to the radio comedy show  "The Goon Show " starring the legendary Peter Sellers  Spike Milligan  and Harry Secombe.Cleese did well in both sports and academics  but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law  but devoted a great deal of time to the university's legendary Footlights group  writing and performing in comedy reviews  often in collaboration with future fellow Python Graham Chapman. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success  including one in particular which toured under the name "Cambridge Circus." When Cleese graduated  he went on to write for the BBC  then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964  which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus  performing and doing a little journalism  and here met Terry Gilliam  another future Python.Returning to England  he began appearing in a BBC radio series  "I'm Sorry  I'll Read That Again"  based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor  Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. He also appeared  briefly  with Brooke-Taylor  Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in At Last the 1948 Show (1967)  for television  and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time  some of whom - Eric Idle  Terry Gilliam  Terry Jones  Michael Palin  and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included The Frost Report (1966) and Marty Feldman's program Marty (1968). Eventually  however  the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program  Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969)  which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor  and remains influential to this day.After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python  Cleese left the show  though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come  including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - Monty Python e il Sacro Graal (1975)  Brian di Nazareth (1979)  Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)  and Monty Python - Il senso della vita (1983). Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth collaborated in the legendary television series Basil e Sybil (1975)  as the sharp-tongued  rude  bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay  England. Only a dozen episodes were made  but each is truly hilarious  and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company  Video Arts  for clever business training videos in which he generally starred  which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies  including in the hit comedy Un pesce di nome Wanda (1988)  in the Harry Potter series  and in the James Bond series as the new Q  starting with Il mondo non basta (1999)  in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects  and frequently does commercials.Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character  Cleese's other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with Connie Booth and a daughter with his second wife  Barbara Trentham.Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976  and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara  California.,1939-10-27,Weston-Super-Mare  Somerset  England  UK,,,3,2

nm0000095,Woody Allen,Allan Stewart Konigsberg,165,Woody Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg on December 1  1935 in Brooklyn  New York  to Nettie (Cherrie)  a bookkeeper  and Martin Konigsberg  a waiter and jewellery engraver. His father was of Russian Jewish descent  and his maternal grandparents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. As a young boy  he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet  two hobbies that he continues today.Allen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper  receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents  Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins  convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and  although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes  he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years  he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Ciao Pussycat (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production  Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers  who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.It was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in Che fai  rubi? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Prendi i soldi e scappa (1969). He has written  directed and  more often than not  starred in about a film a year ever since  while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.While best known for his romantic comedies Io e Annie (1977) and Manhattan (1979)  Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years  transitioning from his "early  funny ones" of Il dittatore dello stato libero di Bananas (1971)  Amore e guerra (1975) and Tutto quello che avreste voluto sapere sul sesso ma non avete mai osato chiedere (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Io e Annie (1977)  Manhattan (1979) and Hannah e le sue sorelle (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Interiors (1978); and then on to the more recent  but varied works of Crimini e misfatti (1989)  Mariti e mogli (1992)  La dea dell'amore (1995)  Celebrity (1998) and Harry a pezzi (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade  which vary from the light comedy of Scoop (2006)  to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and  most recently  to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years  he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.,1935-12-01,Brooklyn  New York City  New York  USA,,,2,2

His debut as the strict Chip Diller in Animal House (1978) almost seems like an inside joke  but he managed to escape almost unnoticed from that role. A cena con gli amici (1982) became the turning point after a couple of television series and a number of less-than-memorable movie roles.

nm0000133,Geena Davis,Virginia Elizabeth Davis,183,As a child  Geena dreamed of being an actress. While in high school  she felt left out and had low self-esteem because  at 6 feet  she was the tallest girl in school. After high school graduation  Geena entered New England College in New Hampshire and then transferred the next year to Boston University  where she majored in drama. In 1977  she graduated and moved to New York to start her career. Her career consisted of sales clerk and waitress. She worked at Ann Taylor  where she eventually rose to Saturday window mannequin while trying to get a job with a modeling agency. Eventually signed by the Zoli Agency  she wound up as a model in the Victoria Secret's Catalogue. Ever vigilant  Sydney Pollack was looking for new talent in the catalog when he spotted Geena and cast her in Tootsie (1982). With good reviews  Geena moved to Los Angeles where she was cast as Wendy in the short-lived but critically acclaimed television series Buffalo Bill (1983) with Dabney Coleman. A starter marriage to restaurant manager Richard Emmolo dissolved around this time. Her next appearance on television was in her own series Sara (1985)  which was also good  but soon canceled. Geena then returned to the big screen in the below-average Una notte in Transilvania (1985) followed by the successful Chevy Chase movie Fletch - Un colpo da prima pagina (1985). From there on  she was on a roll with second husband Jeff Goldblum in the horror remake La mosca (1986).

Ragazze vincenti (1992)  with Tom Hanks and directed by Penny Marshall  was the turning point as her next film  Eroe per caso (1992)  was only average. Then she married director Renny Harlin and they set up a production and development company called "The Forge". Their first film was Ciao Julia  sono Kevin (1994)  which flopped at the box office.

Gershon,168,Since making her uncredited debut as a dancer in Beatlemania (1981)  Gina Gershon has established herself as a character actress and one of the leading icons of American camp. For it was fourteen years after her movie debut that Gina made movie history as the predatory bisexual who was the leading light of a Las Vegas leg-line in director Paul Verhoeven's kitsch classic Showgirls (1995).

nm0000156,Jeff Goldblum,Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum,195,Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum was born October 22  1952 in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  one of four children of Shirley (Temeles)  a radio broadcaster who also ran an appliances firm  and Harold L. Goldblum  a doctor. His father was of Russian Jewish descent and his mother was of Austrian Jewish ancestry.Goldblum began his career on the New York stage after moving to the city at age seventeen. Possessing his own unique style of delivery  Goldblum made an impression on moviegoers with little more than a single line in Woody Allen's Io e Annie (1977)  when he fretted about having forgotten his mantra. Goldblum went on to appear in the remake Terrore dallo spazio profondo (1978) and co-starred with Ben Vereen in the detective series Premiata agenzia Whitney (1980) before a high-profile turn in the classic ensemble film Il grande freddo (1983).The quirky actor turned up in the suitably quirky film Le avventure di Buckaroo Banzai nella quarta dimensione (1984)  which became a 1980s cult classic  starred in the modern-day film noir Tutto in una notte (1985)  then went on to a breakthrough role in the David Cronenberg remake La mosca (1986)  which also featured actress Geena Davis  Goldblum's wife from 1987-1990 and co-star in two additional films: Una notte in Transilvania (1985) and Julien Temple's Le ragazze della Terra sono facili (1988).Goldblum was the rather unlikely star of some of the biggest blockbusters of the 1990s: Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park (1993) and its sequel Il mondo perduto - Jurassic Park (1997)  as well as the alien invasion film Independence Day (1996). These films saw Goldblum playing the type of intellectual characters he has become associated with. More recently  roles have included critically acclaimed turns in Igby Goes Down (2002) and Wes Anderson's Le avventure acquatiche di Steve Zissou (2004). In 2009  he returned to television to star in his second crime series Criminal Intent (2001).,1952-10-22,Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  USA,,,2,2

nm0000158,Tom Hanks,Thomas Jeffrey Hanks,183,Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord  California  to Janet Marylyn (Frager)  a hospital worker  and Amos Mefford Hanks  an itinerant cook. His mother's family  originally surnamed "Fraga"  was entirely Portuguese  while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a "fractured" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce  living with a succession of step-families. No problems  no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown  and auditioned for a community theater play  was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland  and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Splash - Una sirena a Manhattan (1984)  a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother  which eventually went to John Candy. Instead  Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success  grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy La retata (1987)  Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent  both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film  Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Ragazze vincenti (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great  but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair  Hanks noted his "modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top". This "modern era" began for Hanks  first with Insonnia d'amore (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance "charming"  and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia  he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People  Leah Rozen stated  "Above all  credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks  who makes sure that he plays a character  not a saint. He is flat-out terrific  giving a deeply felt  carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar." Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech  he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson  two people with whom he was close  were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: "When I read the script for Gump  I saw it as one of those kind of grand  hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump  becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell  in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast  which included actors Kevin Bacon  Bill Paxton  Gary Sinise  Ed Harris  and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations  winning two. Later that year  Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story - Il mondo dei giocattoli (1995)  as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later  he made his directing debut with the musical comedy Music Graffiti (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group  also playing the role of a music producer.,1956-07-09,Concord  California  USA,,,1,4

nm0000173,Nicole Kidman,Nicole Mary Kidman,180,Elegant Nicole Kidman  known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports  was actually born in Honolulu  Hawaii  while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.Kidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny)  a nursing instructor  and Antony David Kidman  a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English  Irish  and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth  the family moved to Washington  D.C.  where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer  and then  three years later  made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia  where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet  but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years  acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun  the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater  where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16  landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers  including a lead in La banda della Bmx (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent  she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Ore 10: calma piatta (1989).Kidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Giorni di tuono (1990)  she won over the Hollywood hunk hook  line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns)  the couple wed on December 24  1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career  the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991)  then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate - A scuola di gangster (1991). She reunited with Cruise for Cuori ribelli (1992)  the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s  and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life - Questa mia vita (1993). Despite her steady employment  critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995)  but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's Da morire (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path  Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996  Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer  Jane Campion  on the adaptation of Henry James's Ritratto di signora (1996). A few months later  she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997)  adding "action star" to her professional repertoire.She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long  secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks  they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father  a labor advocate)  Nicole and her little sister  Antonia Kidman  discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer  17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image  the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.,1967-06-20,Honolulu  Hawaii  USA,,,1,4
nm0000174,Val Kilmer,Val Edward Kilmer,182,Val Kilmer was born in Los Angeles  California  to Gladys Swanette (Ekstadt) and Eugene Dorris Kilmer  who was a real estate developer and aerospace equipment distributor.

His professional acting career began on stage  and he still participates in theater; he played Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival. His film debut was in the 1984 spoof Top Secret! (1984)  wherein he starred as blond rock idol Nick Rivers. He was in a number of films throughout the 1980s  including the 1986 smash Top Gun (1986). Despite his obvious talent and range  it wasn't until his astonishingly believable performance as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991) that the world sat up and took notice. Kilmer again put his good baritone to use in the movie  performing all of the concert pieces. Since then  he has played two more American legends  Elvis Presley in Una vita al massimo (1993) and Doc Holliday in Tombstone (1993). In July 1994  it was announced that Kilmer would be taking over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne from Michael Keaton.,1959-12-31,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,1,2
nm0000175,Stephen King,Stephen Edwin King,186,Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21  1947  at the Maine General Hospital in Portland. His parents were Nellie Ruth (Pillsbury)  who worked as a caregiver at a mental institute  and Donald Edwin King  a merchant seaman. His father was born under the surname "Pollock " but used the last name "King " under which Stephen was born. He has an older brother  David. The Kings were a typical family until one night  when Donald said he was stepping out for cigarettes and was never heard from again. Ruth took over raising the family with help from relatives. They traveled throughout many states over several years  finally moving back to Durham  Maine  in 1958.Stephen began his actual writing career in January of 1959  when David and Stephen decided to publish their own local newspaper named "Dave's Rag". David bought a mimeograph machine  and they put together a paper they sold for five cents an issue. Stephen attended Lisbon High School  in Lisbon  in 1962. Collaborating with his best friend Chris Chesley in 1963  they published a collection of 18 short stories called "People  Places  and Things--Volume I". King's stories included "Hotel at the End of the Road"  "I've Got to Get Away!"  "The Dimension Warp"  "The Thing at the Bottom of the Well"  "The Stranger"  "I'm Falling"  "The Cursed Expedition"  and "The Other Side of the Fog." A year later  King's amateur press  Triad and Gaslight Books  published a two-part book titled "The Star Invaders".King made his first actual published appearance in 1965 in the magazine Comics Review with his story "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber." The story ran about 6 000 words in length. In 1966 he graduated from high school and took a scholarship to attend the University of Maine. Looking back on his high school days  King recalled that "my high school career was totally undistinguished. I was not at the top of my class  nor at the bottom." Later that summer King began working on a novel called "Getting It On"  about some kids who take over a classroom and try unsuccessfully to ward off the National Guard. During his first year at college  King completed his first full-length novel  "The Long Walk." He submitted the novel to Bennett Cerf/Random House only to have it rejected. King took the rejection badly and filed the book away.He made his first small sale--$35--with the story "The Glass Floor". In June 1970 King graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree in English and a certificate to teach high school. King's next idea came from the poem by Robert Browning  "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came." He found bright colored green paper in the library and began work on "The Dark Tower" saga  but his chronic shortage of money meant that he was unable to further pursue the novel  and it  too  was filed away. King took a job at a filling station pumping gas for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour. Soon he began to earn money for his writings by submitting his short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier.On January 2  1971  he married Tabitha King (born Tabitha Jane Spruce). In the fall of 1971 King took a teaching job at Hampden Academy  earning $6 400 a year. The Kings then moved to Hermon  a town west of Bangor. Stephen then began work on a short story about a teenage girl named Carietta White. After completing a few pages  he decided it was not a worthy story and crumpled the pages up and tossed them into the trash. Fortunately  Tabitha took the pages out and read them. She encouraged her husband to continue the story  which he did. In January 1973 he submitted "Carrie" to Doubleday. In March Doubleday bought the book. On May 12 the publisher sold the paperback rights for the novel to New American Library for $400 000. His contract called for his getting half of that sum  and he quit his teaching job to pursue writing full time. The rest  as they say  is history.Since then King has had numerous short stories and novels published and movies made from his work. He has been called the "Master of Horror". His books have been translated into 33 different languages  published in over 35 different countries. There are over 300 million copies of his novels in publication. He continues to live in Bangor  Maine  with his wife  and writes out of his home.In June 1999 King was severely injured in an accident  he was walking alongside a highway and was hit by a car  that left him in critical condition with injuries to his lung  broken ribs  a broken leg and a severely fractured hip.

nm0000183,Traci Lords,Nora Louise Kuzma,170,Traci Lords is a study of a determined and complex woman with a very controversial background. She was born and raised in Ohio as Nora Louise Kuzma  to Patricia Louise (Kuzma) and Louis Kuzma. She moved with her divorced mother and three sisters to Los Angeles at age 12. While staying at the house of her mother's boyfriend  Roger  she began nude modeling at age 15  then adult films a year later.An incredibly developed  full-figured girl  she easily duped photographers  producers and directors (with the help of a false birth certificate and driver's license). Her stage name is a combination of Traci  from a former school friend  and Lords  in honor of her favorite male actor  Jack Lord (Hawaii Five-O (1968)). She later owned a white Persian cat named Mr. Steve McGarrett  the name of the character Lord played on the show. Traci made somewhere between 80 and 100 X-rated movies (some consisted mostly of leftover footage from previous shoots) between 1984 and 1986.In May 1986 she was arrested by FBI agents when it was discovered she was underage  which meant that any films with her in them were illegal to rent or buy  and video stores around the country rushed to remove them. The only legal porn movie Traci made was Traci  I Love You (1987)  which was filmed in Paris  France  on her 18th birthday. Since she controlled distribution rights  many people believed she orchestrated the revelation herself so she could be the only one to profit from her X-rated career. Many within the adult film industry made a tacit agreement to never promote Traci or talk about her  as they felt she betrayed the industry that had had been the source of her fame in the first place. The federal government tried to prosecute the producers of the movie Those Young Girls (1984)  the first adult film Traci appeared in  for child pornography. However  the case fell apart when the government admitted that it  too  had been duped when Lords traveled to Europe to shoot Traci  I Love You (1987) on a fake passport. After her exile from adult films  she began to resurrect her life and fulfill her lifelong ambition to star in "mainstream" films.In 1987 she enrolled in the Lee Strasberg acting school  began voice lessons and built on her natural acting talents. Her first mainstream "break" came in Not of This Earth (1988)  a remake of the classic Roger Corman sci-fi film from the 1950s. It was the last time that Traci would bare her breasts for the camera.Throughout the 1990s her hard work got her a reputation as a reliable and respected actress  in addition to being a singer and an advocate for gay rights. Her recurring role in early 1995 as a sneering sociopath  Rikki  on Melrose Place (1992) was critically acclaimed and landed her more roles in other movies  playing villains and psychotic characters. In the latter half of the 1990s she appeared in several B movies that went straight to video and/or cable in lead  minor or cameo roles. She even guest-starred in a number of TV shows ranging from Sposati con figli (1987)  Pappa e ciccia (1988)  MacGyver (1985) and Nash Bridges (1996).She has always despised being referred to as "an ex-porn star"  and resents the fact that a celebrity like Tim Allen can be forgiven by Hollywood for past transgressions (he was convicted and served prison time selling drugs while he was in college) but she still to this day bears the stigma of her porn years. It's probably the fantasy of the underage girl who fooled an entire industry  and  at the height of her career  was unquestionably the most popular actress with fans and filmmakers alike.Some of her most notable TV work was as a regular on season 2 of Profiler - intuizioni mortali (1996) from 1997 to 1998 in playing the schizo-sicko serial killer Sharon Lesher  as well as the tough heroine Jordan Radcliffe during the last season of the sci-fi series First Wave (1998) from 2000 to 2001. She most recently has written her autobiography  published in 2003  and even tried her hand in writing and directing a short film which would lead her to another career as a writer-director of independent films.,1968-05-07,Steubenville  Ohio  USA,,,2,1
nm0000186,David Lynch,David Keith Lynch,178,Born in precisely the kind of small-town American setting so familiar from his films  David Lynch spent his childhood being shunted from one state to another as his research scientist father kept getting relocated. He attended various art schools  married Peggy Lynch and then fathered future director Jennifer Lynch shortly after he turned 21. That experience  plus attending art school in a particularly violent and run-down area of Philadelphia  inspired Eraserhead - La mente che cancella (1977)  a film that he began in the early 1970s (after a couple of shorts) and which he would work on obsessively for five years. The final film was initially judged to be almost unreleasable weird  but thanks to the efforts of distributor Ben Barenholtz  it secured a cult following and enabled Lynch to make his first mainstream film (in an unlikely alliance with Mel Brooks)  though The Elephant Man (1980) was shot through with his unique sensibility. Its enormous critical and commercial success led to Dune (1984)  a hugely expensive commercial disaster  but Lynch redeemed himself with the now classic Velluto blu (1986)  his most personal and original work since his debut. He subsequently won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival with the dark  violent road movie Cuore selvaggio (1990)  and achieved a huge cult following with his surreal TV series I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990)  which he adapted for the big screen  though his comedy series On the Air (1992) was less successful. He also draws comic strips and has devised multimedia stage events with regular composer Angelo Badalamenti. He had a much-publicized affair with Isabella Rossellini in the late 1980s.,1946-01-20,Missoula  Montana  USA,,,3,4

At 18 she married rock musician Freddy Moore; the marriage lasted four years. At 19 she became a regular on the soap opera General Hospital (1963).

That lasted more than 3 years  until director Joel Schumacher threatened to fire her from the set of St. Elmo's Fire (1985) when she turned up high. She got a withdrawal treatment and returned clean after a week... and stayed clean. With determination and a skill for publicity stunts  like the nude appearance on cover of Vanity Fair while pregnant  she made her way to fame. Since the huge commercial success of Ghost - Fantasma (1990) and the controversial pictures Proposta indecente (1993) and Rivelazioni (1994) she's one of Hollywood's most sought-after and most expensive actresses.,1962-11-11,Roswell  New Mexico  USA,,,3,3

nm0000211,Mimi Rogers,Miriam Spickler,173,It's fair to say that after 20 years and over 50 film appearances  Mimi Rogers should be praised for her variety of roles and acting capabilities  not for a brief marriage to a Hollywood star. In the early 1980s she began to carve a niche for herself in Hollywood  appearing on television and in films. It was her role in Chi protegge il testimone (1987) that got her noticed and was her springboard to stardom. Cemented by a marriage to Tom Cruise  an already established young actor  Mimi went on to appear in L'intruso (1989)  Ore disperate (1990)  and The Doors (1991). She appeared in a controversial movie analyzing religion in America  Sacrificio fatale (1991)  which proved a hit and delighted audiences  creating many a debate over the film's subject material. She played a bored telephone exchange operator who swaps a sinful life of sex and swinging with other couples for a devout religious one  ending unexpectedly in disaster. Despite her successes  few meaty  interesting roles came her way in the '90s. Una moglie di troppo (1992)  opposite Jeff Goldblum  the family movie Il mio amico zampalesta (1994)  Lontano da casa (1995)  and Il massaggio dell'anima (1995) were just a few of the films that she appeared in. Working consistently  she rejuvenated her career in the unexpected hit Austin Powers - Il controspione (1997)  playing Miss Kensington  an attractive female agent of 1960s London and the mother of Elizabeth Hurley's character. Next  Mimi was seen in the big-screen remake of the '60s sci-fi TV series Lost in Space (1998) and several guest appearances on the hugely popular television series X-Files (1993)  playing a scheming FBI agent. A role in the Canadian indie-horror Licantropia Evolution - Ritorno al presente (2000) did her career no harm. Soon  she was opposite Geena Davis in The Geena Davis Show (2000) from 2000-01 and playing an extremely rich Manhattan socialite in the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000).More recently Mimi has appeared on cable television  including leading roles in Charms for the Easy Life (2002) (which she also executive produced) and Intrappolati al centro della Terra (2003) (a true-life disaster drama in which she played the Chief Superintendent of a mine). In 2004  she gave a revealing performance in The Door in the Floor (2004)  a critical success. The Loop (2006)  a Chicago-based sitcom  will soon be airing in America  featuring Mimi as a flirtatious office worker. Also in 2006  Mimi will be appearing in an original horror film  Penny Dreadful (2006)  playing a psychiatrist in peril.

nm0000215,Susan Sarandon,Susan Abigail Tomalin,170,Susan Sarandon was born Susan Abigail Tomalin in New York City  NY  to homemaker Lenora Marie (Criscione) and Phillip Leslie Tomalin  an advertising executive. She is of Italian descent on her mother's side and English  Irish  Welsh  and German on her father's.After the 1968 Democratic convention there was a casting call for a film with several roles for the kind of young people who had disrupted the convention. Two recent graduates of Catholic University in Washington DC  went to an audition in New York for La guerra del cittadino Joe (1970)  Chris Sarandon (who was passed over) and his wife Susan. Chris brought her along on the audition and she got her big break with a major role: Susan Compton  the daughter of ad executive Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick). In the movie Bill kills Susan's drug-dealer boyfriend  then befriends Joe (Peter Boyle)-- a bigot who works on an assembly line and collects guns.Five years later  Sarandon made the film where fans of cult classics have come to know her as Janet  who gets entangled with transvestite Dr. Frank N. Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). More than 15 years after beginning her career Sarandon at last actively campaigned for a great role  Annie in Bull Durham - Un gioco a tre mani (1988)  flying at her own expense from Rome to Los Angeles. "It was such a wonderful script ... and did away with a lot of myths and challenged the American definition of success"  she said. "When I got there  I spent some time with Kevin Costner  kissed some ass at the studio and got back on a plane". Her romance with the Bull Durham - Un gioco a tre mani (1988) supporting actor  Tim Robbins  had produced two sons by 1992 and put Sarandon in the position of leaving her domestic paradise only to accept roles that really challenged her. The result was four Academy Award nominations in the 1990s and best actress for Dead Man Walking - Condannato a morte (1995). Her first Academy Award nomination was for Louis Malle's Atlantic City (1980).,1946-10-04,New York City  New York  USA,,,1,0

The enigmatic Seagal commenced his martial arts training at the age of seven under the tutelage of well-known karate instructor and author Fumio Demura  and in the 1960s commenced his aikido training in Orange County  CA  under the instruction of Harry Ishisaka. Seagal received his first dan accreditation in 1974  after he had moved to Japan to further his martial arts training. After spending many years there honing his skills  he achieved the ranking of a 7th dan in the Japanese martial art "aikido" and was instructing wealthy clients in Los Angeles when he came to the attention of Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz.Ovitz saw star value in the imposing-looking Seagal. The high-octane action movie genre was in full swing in the late 1980s  and Seagal's debut movie  "Above the Law"  was wildly received by action fans and actually received some complimentary critical reviews. He followed up "Above the Law" with another slam-bang thriller  Duro da uccidere (1990)  as a cop shot in an ambush by the mob who revives from a coma to take his revenge. The movie also starred Seagal's wife at the time  leggy Kelly LeBrock  who was married to him from 1987 to 1996 and is the mother of three of his children. His next outing was battling voodoo-using Jamaican drug "posses" in the hyper-violent Programmato per uccidere (1990)  before returning to fight psychotic mob gangster William Forsythe in the even more punishing Giustizia a tutti i costi (1991). Seagal was by now enormously popular  and his next movie  the big-budgeted Trappola in alto mare (1992)  set aboard the battleship USS Missouri and also starring Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey  was arguably his best film to date  impressing both fans and critics alike.Seagal's fighting style was rather different from that of other on-screen martial arts dynamos such as Bruce Lee  Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme  who were predominantly fighters from striking arts background such as karate or tang soo do. However  aikido is built around using an opponent's inertia and body weight to employ various locks  chokes and holds that incapacitate him. Seagal carries himself differently  too  and often appears wearing Italian designer clothes and usually favors an all-black outfit  generally with a three-quarter-length coat with an elaborate trim. Additionally  Seagal's on-screen characters were often seemingly benign or timid individuals; however  when the going gets rough they reveal themselves to be deadly ex-CIA operatives  or retired Special Forces soldiers capable of enormous destruction!As his box-office drawing power grew  Seagal began to infuse his film projects with his personal and spiritual beliefs  especially concerning the abuse of the environment. He appeared as an oil fire expert who turns against his corrupt CEO (played by Michael Caine) in Sfida tra i ghiacci (1994) to save the Eskimo population from an oil disaster; in Fire Down Below - L'inferno sepolto (1997) he plays an environmental agency troubleshooter investigating the dumping of toxic waste in Kentucky coal mines  and in the slow-moving The Patriot (1998) he plays a medical specialist trying to stop a lethal virus unleashed by an extremist group.Action fans struggled to come to terms with social messaging being built into bone-crunching fight films; however  Seagal's box-office clout remained fairly strong  and more traditional chopsocky projects followed with the "buddy cop" film Delitti inquietanti (1996)  then almost a cameo role as a Navy SEAL alongside CIA analyst Kurt Russell before Seagal is sucked out of a jet at 35 000 feet in Decisione critica (1996).In 1999 Seagal took a different turn in his film projects with the surprising genteel Prince of Central Park (2000)  about a child living inside NYC's most famous park. He returned to more familiar territory with further high-voltage  guns-blazing action in Ferite mortali (2001)  Infiltrato speciale (2002)  Il vendicatore (2003) and Belly of the Beast - Ultima missione (2003).Unbeknownst to many  in 1997 Seagal publicly announced that one of his Buddhist teachers  His Holiness Penor Rinpoche  had accorded Seagal as a tulku  the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama. This initial announcement was met with some disbelief until Penor Rinpoche himself gave a confirmation statement on Seagal's new title. Seagal has repeatedly discussed his involvement in Buddhism and how he devotes many hours studying and meditating this ancient Eastern religion.While his box-office appeal has somewhat declined from his halcyon blockbusters of the mid-'90s  Seagal still has a very loyal fan base in the action movie genre and continues to remain a highly bankable star.,1952-04-10,Lansing  Michigan  USA,,,2,6
nm0000222,Brooke Shields,Brooke Christa Shields,183,"Want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing". If you have not heard of Brooke Shields before  this tagline from her Calvin Klein Jeans ad had to grab your attention. Not that she has not had a previously noteworthy resume. She was born on May 31  1965 in New York City and  at age 12  she starred as a child prostitute in Pretty Baby (1978). Could this movie even be made today? It was considered risky and controversial in 1978. It was followed by another blockbuster  the romance adventure drama Laguna blu (1980). Brooke has proved herself to be so much more than her early films. Her broad range of work as an adult would be quite an achievement for anyone  especially given how difficult transitioning from child actor to adult often is.She has never stopped working  whether it be a Bob Hope Christmas special  her own sitcom Susan (1996) or as an author. She also managed to work on a degree from Princeton University. She has received a number of awards during her career  most notably The People's Choice award for 1981 through 1984 in the category of Favorite Young Performer. In 1997  she was honored again with The People's Choice award for Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series in 1997 for her work in Susan (1996). In her personal life  she was married in 1997 to tennis player Andre Agassi and was devastated when they divorced two years later. She married for the second time in 2001 to Chris Henchy. She has been open about using fertility treatments to become pregnant with their daughter  Rowan  born in 2003.When suffering debilitating depression after the birth of her daughter  she made the decision to put her feelings down on paper. Her book  "Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression"  takes a hard  honest look at what she and many other women experience after childbirth. She still lives in New York City  and is still sought after for work in movies  television  and on stage. Pretty nice list of achievements for the once Calvin Klein jeans girl.,1965-05-31,New York City  New York  USA,,,0,2
nm0000224,Alicia Silverstone,Alicia Silverstone,165,Alicia Silverstone was born on October 4  1976 in San Francisco  California  the youngest of three children. She is the daughter of Didi (Radford)  a former flight attendant  and Monty Silverstone  a real estate investor. Her English-born father is from a Jewish family  while her Scottish-born mother converted to Judaism. Alicia's career began at the tender age of six  when her father took some photos of his young daughter  which eventually led to her getting several television commercials. After a guest spot on The Wonder Years (1988) as a literal "dream girl"  she moved on to movies. She landed a role in La ragazza della porta accanto (1993)  a sort of Attrazione fatale (1987) for teenagers in which she portrayed a disturbed young girl obsessed with an older man. The nasty little role did not impress the critical establishment but it wowed its target audience: teenagers. In fact  the role won her the 1994 MTV Movie Award for "Best Villain" and "Breakthrough Performance". It is interesting to note that during the filming of the movie  Alicia became an emancipated minor in order to get around child labor laws which would have interfered with her working hours. She was a dedicated actress from early on.The film also caught the attention of Aerosmith  who hired her to appear in a string of their music videos. The first of them  "Cryin'"  was voted the #1 video of all time on MTV. Silverstone was definitely a hit with the MTV crowd  but larger commercial success still eluded her. That all changed when she landed the role of Cher in Amy Heckerling's Ragazze a Beverly Hills (1995). Cher was the antithesis of Alicia's role in The Crush; this time around  she was a rich  naive yet endearing girl from Beverly Hills in search of love in the 1990s. The film was a huge box-office hit and wowed both audiences and critics alike and demonstrated Alicia's strength and bankability. She was hailed as the woman of the hour  and branded the spokeswoman for an emerging young generation. She signed a deal with Columbia TriStar worth $10 million and got the coveted role of Batgirl in the Batman franchise. Also  as part of the package  she received a three-year first-look deal for her own production company  First Kiss Productions. The first film released by First Kiss was Una ragazza sfrenata (1997).,1976-10-04,San Francisco  California  USA,,,1,1
nm0000226,Will Smith,Willard Carroll Smith Jr.,188,Willard Carroll "Will" Smith  Jr. (born September 25  1968) is an American actor  comedian  producer  rapper  and songwriter.

In 1990  his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended  Smith moved from television to film  and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office  eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally  and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes.

He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia  the son of Caroline (Bright)  a Philadelphia school board administrator  and Willard Carroll Smith  Sr.  a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood  and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings  sister Pamela  who is four years older  and twins Harry and Ellen  who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes  a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13  but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported  it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he "wanted to rap." Smith says he was admitted to a "pre-engineering [summer] program" at MIT for high school students  but he did not attend. According to Smith  "My mother  who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia  had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids  so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince  with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as producer  as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous  radio-friendly songs  most notably "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime". They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith  took many of his possessions  and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990  when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world"  studying box office successes' common characteristics. Smith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996  Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster  becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998  Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West  Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision  asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved  although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he "made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better."In 2005  Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10  2007  Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month  Smith starred in the film I Am Legend  released December 14  2007. Despite marginally positive reviews  its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique". A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood." On December 1  2008  TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4  2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh  in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.Men in Black III opened on May 25  2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.On August 19  2011  it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I.  Chris Brown  and Game.

CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death.

nm0000227,Mira Sorvino,Mira Katherine Sorvino,178,Mira Katherine Sorvino was born on September 28  1967 in Manhattan. She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis  an actress turned drama therapist  and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father's family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent  an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor  as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard  majoring in Chinese  graduating magna cum laude in 1989  largely on the strength of her thesis  a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China  written and researched during the year spent in Beijing  which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.However  she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age  and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City's film industry  waitressing  auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s  but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Tra amici (1993)  on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film  and  more importantly  was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received  and Sorvino's performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies  one a more prominent indie  Barcelona (1994)  the other her first Hollywood feature  Quiz Show (1994)  and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.An exceptionally poised and articulate young woman  she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker  but Woody Allen took the chance  and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his La dea dell'amore (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar  Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles  including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Norma Jean e Marilyn (1996)  co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress  Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror  such as Mimic (1997) and Costretti ad uccidere (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.However  what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy & Michelle (1997)  in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.Mira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11  2004  and the couple have four children.,1967-09-28,New York City  New York  USA,,,0,4
nm0000228,Kevin Spacey,Kevin Spacey Fowler,177,Kevin Spacey Fowler  better known by his stage name Kevin Spacey  is an American actor of screen and stage  film director  producer  screenwriter and singer. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995)  and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994)  psychological thriller Seven (1995)  the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997)  the drama Pay It Forward (2000)  the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)In Broadway theatre  Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013  Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.As enigmatic as he is talented  Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard  "the less you know about me  the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person". In October 2017  he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had enjoyed sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as homosexual.There are  however  certain biographical facts to be had - for starters  Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler  in South Orange  New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His mother was a personal secretary  his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California  where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister's tree house on fire  he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy  only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley  where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year  he played "Captain von Trapp" opposite classmate Mare Winningham's "Maria" in "The Sound of Music" (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age  when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later  in high school  he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College  then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate  Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work  so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of "Henry VI".Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the "real world" of theater  and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts". He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point  he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe's "Hurlyburly"). In 1986  he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor  Jack Lemmon  on a production of Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night". While his interest soon turned to film  Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991  he won a Tony Award for his turn as "Uncle Louie" in Neil Simon's Broadway hit "Lost in Yonkers" and  in 1999  he returned to the boards for a revival of O'Neill's "The Iceman Cometh".Spacey's film career began modestly  with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn - Affari di cuore (1986). Deemed more of a "character actor" than a "leading man"  he stayed on the periphery in his next few films  but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain "Mel Profitt" on the TV series Oltre la legge - L'informatore (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark  manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Americani (1992)  a sadistic Hollywood exec in Il prezzo di Hollywood (1994)  and  most famously  creepy  smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in I soliti sospetti (1995).The "Suspects" role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year  he turned in another complex  eerie performance in David Fincher's thriller Seven (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film  fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now  the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino's Riccardo III - Un uomo  un re (1996)  Spacey made his own directorial debut with Insoliti criminali (1996)  a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting  winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel  closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997). In October 1999  just four days after the dark suburban comedy American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters  Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham  a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown  he tapped into a funny  savage character that captured audiences' imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts  Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he's finished exploring the dark side - but  given his attraction to complex characters  that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre  The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether  he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years  and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production  of which he was the director  was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film  Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues  but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic  and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best  and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles  the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.In 2013  Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series  House of Cards - Gli intrighi del potere (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name  House of Cards is an American political drama. The show's first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017  he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller Baby Driver - Il genio della fuga (2017).,1959-07-26,South Orange  New Jersey  USA,,,0,0

Quentin moved with his mother to Torrance  California  when he was four years old.In January of 1992  first-time writer-director Tarantino's Le iene (1992) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later  he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival  winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards  it was nominated for the best picture  best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995  Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Four Rooms (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell  Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was Dal tramonto all'alba (1996)  a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well theatrically.Since then  Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films  including Jackie Brown (1997)  Kill Bill - Volume 1 (2003)  Kill Bill - Volume 2 (2004)  Bastardi senza gloria (2009)  Django Unchained (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015).,1963-03-27,Knoxville  Tennessee  USA,,,0,1

nm0000239,Liv Tyler,Liv Rundgren,178,Liv Tyler is an actress of international renown and has been a familiar face on our screens for over two decades and counting. She began modelling at the age of fourteen before pursuing a career in acting. After making her film debut in Bruce Beresford's Silent Fall  she was cast by fledgling director James Mangold (who would go on to direct such hits as Girl  Interrupted  Walk the Line and Logan) in his first feature Heavy  a critical and commercial success that went on to gain cult status. This was followed by another indie cult hit  Empire Records  but it was the leading role in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty that catapulted her to stardom at the age of eighteen.Liv was next seen in Tom Hanks' hugely successful passion project That Thing You Do!  his paean to the glory days of 1960s rock 'n' roll (as the child of a rock 'n' roll background  this was a film whose subject was also dear to Liv's heart). This was followed by Michael Bay's action blockbuster Armageddon  starring alongside Bruce Willis  Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi  who would later go on to direct Liv in Lonesome Jim.Liv had come to the attention of director Robert Altman in Stealing Beauty and the late  great auteur went on to cast her in two of his final projects  Cookie's Fortune and Dr T and the Women  describing her as "very serious  very prepared and very professional...I am crazy about her."In between her work for Altman  Liv starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in Onegin  directed by his sister Martha  from the classic novel by Alexander Pushkin. Ralph Fiennes said of Liv  "We tested a lot of actresses but Liv has an acute sense of emotional truth that's not performed or projected  but just is."In 2001  Liv portrayed Arwen in the ground-breaking epic The Lord of the Rings trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring  The Two Towers and The Return of the King.Nothing if not eclectic  Liv then defied expectations by starring in cult director Kevin Smith's gentle low-budget comedy Jersey Girl  re-uniting her with her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck  before playing Betty  the female lead to Edward Norton's Bruce Banner in Marvel's The Incredible Hulk.An actress who consistently refuses to be pigeonholed  Liv's career is one that cuts across genres; she cannot be defined by the roles she has chosen and is led  above all  by what speaks to her on an instinctual and emotional level. "It's very difficult to say no to whatever comes along " Tom Hanks has said of her  "...But she's saying no to all the right things."In addition to her acting work  Liv has forged a decade-long relationship with Givenchy as the spokesperson for their fragrance and cosmetics line. Liv is also a brand ambassador for Triumph lingerie  developing a capsule collection that celebrates the company's commitment to body confidence  as exemplified by Liv herself  "a modern woman in every sense  a mother and actress with a fierce sense of femininity that women across the world can relate to."Liv's previous design collaboration was with Belstaff  resulting in two capsule collections for the iconic British heritage brand. Liv has also been the face of commercial campaigns for several global brands  including Visa and Pantene.,1977-07-01,New York City  New York  USA,,,1,1

nm0000242,Mark Wahlberg,Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg,173,American actor Mark Wahlberg is one of a handful of respected entertainers who successfully made the transition from teen pop idol to acclaimed actor. A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for The Departed - Il bene e il male (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in The Fighter (2010)  Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor  proven by his starring role in Ted (2012).Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5  1971 in a poor working class district  Dorchester  of Boston  Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly)  a nurse's aide and clerk  and Donald Edward Wahlberg  a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather)  French-Canadian  English  Irish and Scottish  descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up  especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment  none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce  she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing  working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen  he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction  he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there  he began working out to pass time and  when he emerged at the end of his sentence  he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time  his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze  the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract  and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch  with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability  promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark  who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his "Funky Bunch" and "Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch" was born. His debut album  "Music for the People"  was a smash hit  which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage  not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping "bad boy". Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein  Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically  while the New Kids on the Block's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics  "Marky Mark's" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992  he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights  most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense  they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However  when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press  things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after  while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks  he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified  Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality  homophobia and racial hatred. His second album  "You Gotta Believe"  had not been faring well and  after the charges surfaced  it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla  Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world  Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle  acting. He dropped the "Marky Mark" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall's Mezzo professore tra i marines (1994). Despite the name change  many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go  he was proving them wrong. In Mezzo professore tra i marines (1994)  he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial Ritorno dal nulla (1995) and chilled them in Paura (1996) as every father's worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights - L'altra Hollywood (1997). Since then  Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability  starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Three Kings (1999) and La tempesta perfetta (2000)  popcorn flicks like Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001) and Contraband (2012)  and even indies such as I Heart Huckabees - Le strane coincidenze della vita (2004).Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire: L'impero del crimine (2010)  In Treatment (2008) and the highly successful comedy Entourage (2004)  which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.,1971-06-05,Dorchester  Boston  Massachusetts  USA,,,0,4

nm0000259,Ginger Lynn,Ginger Lynn,163,Born in Rockford  Illinois  on December 14  1962  Ginger Lynn Allen went to California in 1982 to visit her ill grandfather. She decided to stay and found employment as a manager at a Musicland record store in Redlands. She had lived in a trailer in one of the worst parts of the city for almost a year when she answered an ad for figure models. This led to employment the same day and a layout in Penthouse magazine. Work in the adult-film industry soon followed. She worked in the industry from December 1983 through February 1986  making a total of 69 films (plus countless re-issues and compilations). She retired  partially because the work was no longer fun and she had very little time off. That same year  she was approached by the FBI to testify on behalf of Traci Lords  who had just been exposed as having been underage during her years in the adult-film industry. She refused and was eventually arrested for tax evasion. Following her years in adult movies  she appeared in many "legit" films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s-- most notably the "Vice Academy" films. She also starred in Metallica's music video "Turn the Page." She has a son  who she gave birth to on March 24  1996. She tours gentlemen's clubs around the country  and signed a comeback deal with VCA Pictures in 1999. She has starred in four new adult movies so far: Torn (1999)  White Lightning (2000)  New Wave Hookers 6 (2000) and Taken (2001).,1962-12-14,Rockford  Illinois  USA,,,0,0
nm0000260,Joan Allen,Joan Allen,178,Joan Allen was born on August 20  1956 in Rochelle  Illinois  the youngest of four children. She is the daughter of homemaker Dorothea Marie (Wirth) and gas station owner James Jefferson Allen. Her mother's family was German  and her father had English  Scots-Irish  and German ancestry. She attended Rochelle Township High School where she was voted most likely to succeed. Joining Chicago's famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensemble in 1977  she was one of the group's original members and starred in a number of its original productions. Her first major film credits included two critically-lauded supporting performances that showcased her versatility: a comedic turn in the suburban murder mystery Posizioni compromettenti (1985) and a dramatic role as a blind woman befriended by a serial killer in Manhunter - Frammenti di un omicidio (1986). Around the same time  Allen was making a name for herself on the New York stage; she would eventually become one of the New York theater world's most honored actresses and a winner of every major prize for her work on Broadway and off. She received a Best Actress Tony Award in 1988 for her performance  opposite John Malkovich  in Lanford Wilson's Burn This and was Tony-nominated in the same category in 1989 for the title role in The Heidi Chronicles.Continuing her work in film as well  Allen received her first Academy Award nomination for her role as Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's Gli intrighi del potere - Nixon (1995)  for which she also won awards from seven critics' associations  including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics. Allen received her second consecutive Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role in Arthur Miller's La seduzione del male (1996). Subsequently  her work in Tempesta di ghiaccio (1997)  opposite Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver  and in Pleasantville (1998)  opposite William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels  earned her high praise and several critics' awards; she also co-starred in the action blockbuster Face/Off - Due facce di un assassino (1997) opposite John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. For her starring role in The Contender (2000)  Allen received Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes  the Academy Awards  the SAG Awards  and the Independent Spirit Awards.Throughout the early 2000s Allen worked in both film and television  with roles in three of the Bourne films - The Bourne Supremacy (2004)  The Bourne Ultimatum - Il ritorno dello sciacallo (2007)  and The Bourne Legacy (2012) - as well as Le pagine della nostra vita (2004)  Litigi d'amore (2005)  and Death Race (2008). Allen also received Emmy nominations for Le nebbie di Avalon (2001) and for the title role in the biopic Georgia O'Keeffe (2009)  for which she was also executive producer. She was also recently seen in HBO's drama series Luck (2011).Allen married actor Peter Friedman in 1990  and the two divorced in 2002; Allen's daughter Sadie was born in 1994.,1956-08-20,Rochelle  Illinois  USA,,,1,1
nm0000261,Karen Allen,Karen Jane Allen,165,Karen Jane Allen was born in Carrollton  rural southern Illinois  to Patricia (Howell)  a teacher  and Carroll Thompson Allen  an FBI agent. She spent her first 10 years traveling around the country with her parents and two sisters. She was always "the new girl in school." Acting did not really cross Allen's mind until she was in her early 20s  when she saw a Jerzy Grotowski theater production that impressed her so much  she instantly decided to give it a shot. She trained as a classical actress and enrolled at the Actors Studio and with Lee Strasberg in New York City. During this period  she made several student films and directed and acted in several plays. In 1976  she made her first film appearance in the award-winning small film The Whidjitmaker (1976).Her first major film role came as Katy in 1978's National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)  which became one of the biggest hits of the year  obtained "classic" status  and launched a whole host of young "hot" stars. However  shortly after Animal House (1978) opened  Allen was struck by a rare and dangerous eyesight condition called keratoconjunctivitis. Luckily  the condition subsided and Allen could continue her dramatic rise to the top. Lead roles in cult favorites like The Wanderers - I nuovi guerrieri (1979) and the controversial thriller Cruising (1980) followed  as did smaller parts as in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979). However  it was her performance in Rob Cohen's Una piccola cerchia di amici (1980)  as well as her previously mentioned turn in Animal House (1978)  that caught the eye of a certain Steven Spielberg. He then cast her as the feisty heroine and co-star of Harrison Ford in his big-budget blockbuster I predatori dell'arca perduta (1981)  which became a huge hit in 1981-82 and is regarded by many film buffs as the greatest action-adventure film ever made.Following the huge success of I predatori dell'arca perduta (1981)  Allen chose to spend more than two years out of the limelight  concentrating on smaller  more personal projects. She won a major award for her performances on Broadway  won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Abra in the hugely successful ABC production of La valle dell'Eden (1981)  and had parts in two smaller films: Alan Parker's Spara alla luna (1982) and Punto debole (1982)  co-starring James Woods and Peter Fonda. She returned to the mainstream in 1984 with Until September (1984) and Starman (1984)  co-starring Jeff Bridges and directed by John Carpenter (of Halloween - La notte delle streghe (1978) fame)  but once again decided to leave the limelight for a couple of years to do more stage work and some troubled indie films. While Allen has worked almost constantly since then  giving notable performances in Paul Newman's screen adaptation of Lo zoo di vetro (1987)  the Christmas hit S.O.S. fantasmi (1988)  and Steven Soderbergh's underrated Piccolo  grande Aaron (1993)  she has not been able to scale the same dizzy heights as the early 1980s hits. Most of her lead roles in feature films since Starman (1984) have not been that well-received (Animal Behavior (1989)  Killer machine (1993)  and The Turning (1992) among them). However  she has been seen to good effect on TV in such films as Challenger - lo shuttle della morte (1990)  in which she portrayed tragic schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe  and L'inverno del nostro amore (1997)  co-starring Richard Chamberlain.She has also made special guest star appearances on such shows as Law & Order - I due volti della giustizia (1990)  California (1979)  and Alfred Hitchcock presenta (1985)  and in several TV movies  including Le ragioni di una donna (1996) and Arma segreta (1990). She also played the lead in the CBS series The Road Home (1994). Karen Allen was married to soap star Kale Browne (with whom she co-starred in Solo se il destino (1997)) in 1988 and they have a son  Nicholas. Apart from acting  Allen is also an accomplished singer  songwriter  and musician. She played in a band with Kathleen Turner  and recorded a duet with Jeff Bridges for the Starman (1984) soundtrack album.She also writes plays  screenplays  and poetry; owns her own Ashtanga yoga enterprise; and spends time at her Berkshire Mountains farm or Upper West Side Manhattan townhouse. The classically trained actress also has a screenplay called "The Second Coming " which is about to be made into a movie. Most recently she has starred opposite Peter Coyote in The Basket (1999)  and appeared in the blockbuster La tempesta perfetta (2000)  in which she co-starred with George Clooney  Mark Wahlberg  and Diane Lane. In addition to these  she is working on Shaka Zulu: The Citadel (2001) and recently made an independent film  In the Bedroom (2001). Karen Allen is undoubtedly one of the most talented  ambitious  and versatile actresses of the last 20 years. In many ways  her own choices to "go back to theater and smaller projects" are the only things that have really stopped her being a major  major star. Allen was voted one of the most beautiful women in the world in 1983  and is a naturally attractive lady - who often plays characters significantly younger than herself. She also often plays unglamorous types - and there is no one better at portraying real  human  and wholly believable people.,1951-10-05,Carrollton  Illinois  USA,,,1,1

nm0000267,Julie Andrews,Julia Elizabeth Wells,173,Julia Elizabeth Wells was born on October 1  1935  in England. Her mother  Barbara Ward (Morris)  and stepfather  both vaudeville performers  discovered her freakish but undeniably lovely four-octave singing voice and immediately got her a singing career. She performed in music halls throughout her childhood and teens  and at age 20  she launched her stage career in a London Palladium production of "Cinderella".Andrew came to Broadway in 1954 with "The Boy Friend"  and became a bona fide star two years later in 1956  in the role of Eliza Doolittle in the unprecedented hit "My Fair Lady". Her star status continued in 1957  when she starred in the TV-production of Cinderella (1957) and through 1960  when she played "Guenevere" in "Camelot".In 1963  Walt Disney asked Andrews if she would like to star in his upcoming production  a lavish musical fantasy that combined live-action and animation. She agreed on the condition if she didn't get the role of Doolittle in the pending film production of My Fair Lady (1964). After Audrey Hepburn was cast in My Fair Lady  Andrews made an auspicious film debut in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964)  which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress.Andrews continued to work on Broadway  until the release of Tutti insieme appassionatamente (1965)  the highest-grossing movie of its day and one of the highest-grossing of all time. She soon found that audiences identified her only with singing  sugary-sweet nannies and governesses  and were reluctant to accept her in dramatic roles in Tempo di guerra  tempo d'amore (1964) and Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Il sipario strappato (1966). In addition  the box-office showings of the musicals Julie subsequently made increasingly reflected the negative effects of the musical-film boom that she helped to create. Millie (1967) was for a time the most successful film Universal had released  but it still couldn't compete with Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music for worldwide acclaim and recognition. Un giorno... di prima mattina (1968) and Operazione crepes suzette (1970) also bombed at the box office.Fortunately  Andrews did not let this keep her down. She worked in nightclubs and hosted a TV variety series in the 1970s. In 1979  Andrews returned to the big screen  appearing in films directed by her husband Blake Edwards  with roles that were entirely different from anything she had been seen in before. Andrews starred in 10 (1979)  S.O.B. (1981) and Victor Victoria (1982)  which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.She continued acting throughout the 1980s and 1990s in movies and TV  hosting several specials and starring in a short-lived sitcom. In 2001  she starred in Pretty Princess (2001)  alongside then-newcomer Anne Hathaway. The family film was one of the most successful G-Rated films of that year  and Andrews reprised her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in Principe azzurro cercasi (2004). In recent years  Andrews appeared in L'acchiappadenti (2010)  as well as a number of voice roles in Shrek 2 (2004)  Shrek Terzo (2007)  Come d'incanto (2007)  Shrek e vissero felici e contenti (2010)  and Cattivissimo me (2010).,1935-10-01,Walton-on-Thames  Surrey  England  UK,,,1,3

Trinian's sketch in the school concert of 1982 gave an early indication of her theatrical leanings. She studied at the London drama and dance school  "Italia Conti". She appeared in many British television productions before making her film debut in Manifesto (1988).Her first American movie was Un agente segreto al liceo (1991)  in which she played the daughter of a murdered British Agent (played by Roger Daltrey). In 1992  she made a guest appearance on Beverly Hills  90210 (1990) as "Tricia Kinney".

She was raised in Monte Carlo where she was educated at a convent school. A voracious reader  she discovered Proust at age 15 and felt as though his writings were for her.When she was 17 her father died and the shock of his loss never left her. Shortly before his death Ardant started acting on stage. However following her father's death she followed his advice and went to university in Aix-en-Provence where she read Political Science. Upon graduation she took a job working for the French embassy in London from which she was sacked for poor time keeping and being dishevelled. The latter was attributed to the social whirl she enjoyed in London.Ardant continued working odd jobs in London before deciding  almost on a whim  to go to drama school. She returned to France for her studies and before long began acting on stage and then on television. At the age of 31 she was contacted by Francois Truffaut who had spotted her in a television drama and wanted to cast her in his film The Woman Next Door (1981).While working together Ardant and Truffaut fell in love and in 1983 she gave birth to their daughter Josephine.

Arkin demonstrated his dramatic range as the psychopathic killer Roat in suspense film Gli occhi della notte (1967)  opposite Audrey Hepburn. He reinvented himself as the sensitive deaf-mute in L'urlo del silenzio (1968)  for which he received his second Academy Award Nomination as Best Actor in the Leading role.

He passed away tragically early in 1979 at the age of 31.Kate attended the private school Godolphin and Latymer School in London for her grade and primary school education. In her teens she twice won the British bookseller W.H. Smith Young Writers' competition - once for three short stories and once for three poems. After a tumultuous adolescence (a bout of anorexia - cured - and a smoking habit which continues to this day)  she gradually took up the profession of acting.Her major acting debut came in a TV film about World War II called One Against the Wind (1991)  filmed in Luxembourg during the summer of 1991. It first aired on American television that December. Kate began attending Oxford University's New College in the fall of 1991  majoring in French and Russian literature. She had already decided that she wanted to act  but to broaden her horizons she chose university over drama school. While in her first year at Oxford  Kate received her big break in Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of William Shakespeare's Molto rumore per nulla (1993). Kate worked in three other films while attending Oxford  beginning with a part in the medieval historical drama Prince of Jutland (1994)  cast as Ethel. The film was shot during the spring of 1993 on location in Denmark  and she filmed her supporting part during New College's Easter break. Later in the summer of that year she played the lead in the contemporary mystery drama Scacco matto (1994). Before she went back to school  her third year at university was spent at Oxford's study-abroad program in Paris  France  immersing herself in the French language  Parisian culture and French cigarettes.A year away from the academic community and living on her own in the French capital caused her to re-evaluate the direction of her life. She faced a choice: continue with school or concentrate on her flourishing acting career. After much thought  she chose the acting career. In the spring of 1994 Kate left Oxford  after finishing three years of study. Kate appeared in the BBC/Thames Television satire Cold Comfort Farm (1995)  filmed in London and East Sussex during late summer 1994 and which opened to spectacular reviews in the United States  grossing over $5 million during its American run. It was re-released to U.K. theaters in the spring of 1997.Acting on the stage consumed the first part of 1995; she toured in England with the Thelma Holts Theatre Company production of Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull". After turning down several mediocre scripts "and going nearly berserk with boredom"  she waited seven months before another interesting role was offered to her. Her big movie of 1995 was the romance/horror movie Fantasmi (1995)  starring opposite Aidan Quinn and John Gielgud  and filmed in West Sussex. In this film she wanted to play "an object of desire"  unlike her past performances where her characters were much less the siren and more the worldly innocent. Kate's first film project of 1996 was the British ITV production of Jane Austen's novel Emma (1996). Her last film of 1996 was the comedy Big Fish (1997)  filmed at Shepperton Studios in London during early fall. She played the part of Georgie  an altruistic con artist.

nm0000300,Juliette Binoche,Juliette Binoche,168,Juliette Binoche was born in Paris  France  to Monique Yvette Stalens  a director  teacher  and actress  and Jean-Marie Binoche  a sculptor  director  and actor. Her mother was born in Czestochowa  Poland  of French  Walloon Belgian  and Polish descent  while her father is French. Juliette was only 23 when she first attracted the attention of international film critics with L'insostenibile leggerezza dell'essere (1988). Roger Ebert  Chicago Sun-Times film critic with an international following of his books on film and TV reviews  wrote that she was "almost ethereal in her beauty and innocence". That innocence was gone by the time Binoche completed Louis Malle's Il danno (1992) (aka "Fatale"). In an interview after the film was released  Binoche said: "Malle was trying direct and wanted something more sophisticated". A year later  Krzysztof Kieslowski's Tre colori - Film blu (1993) was added to her film credits.

nm0000301,Thora Birch,Thora Birch,163,For some people  oatmeal starts the day off right - for Thora Birch  it launched a healthy career in front of the camera. It's hard to believe that the actress  who slunk into stardom with her turn as the disillusioned daughter in American Beauty (1999)  is even related to the apple-cheeked blonde who once gazed up at Quaker Oats (R) spokesman Wilford Brimley and said  "Mmm-hmm. Yeah  grandpa"  but Birch still remembers the professional advice Brimley whispered in her ear: maintain eye contact and *really* listen. Since then  she's had ample opportunity to study some of Hollywood's top talents at work - in addition to her American Beauty (1999) scenes with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening  she's acted alongside Harrison Ford  Harvey Keitel and Jeremy Irons. Named after Thor  the Norse god of thunder  Thora was born in Los Angeles to Jack Birch and Carol Connors Birch (they kept up the tempestuous theme by naming her younger brother Bolt Birch). By age 4  she was a regular at commercial auditions and  by age 6  she'd landed a spot on the short-lived daycare sitcom Day by Day (1988). Her film career got off to an auspicious start that same year  when she won a Young Artist Award for her debut opposite Neil Patrick Harris in the children's fantasy flick Amico venuto dallo spazio (1988). After a short break  she picked up a role in another fleeting sitcom  Fra nonni e nipoti (1990) (based on the movie of the same name). By age 9  Birch had her life pretty much figured out - she told the L.A. Times that she planned to become a director by 24  then spend a year ice skating  then spend a year as a policewoman  and  finally  become a singer. She picked up her last name (early appearances credited her as just "Thora") and returned to the big screen as Elijah Wood's tomboy friend in La strada per il paradiso (1991). She then scored a high-profile supporting role as Harrison Ford's daughter in Giochi di potere (1992)  which she reprised in Sotto il segno del pericolo (1994). In between  she kept busy with family films Hocus Pocus (1993) and Il mio amico zampalesta (1994). In 1995  Birch graduated into adolescent territory with her turn as a younger Melanie Griffith in Amiche per sempre (1995). She followed that up with a top-billed role in the snowy adventure Alaska (1996)  then took a three-year hiatus from acting. She resurfaced in 1999  first in the made-for-TV Un nuovo inizio (1999) and then  more visibly  in American Beauty (1999). Birch had heard about "Beauty" through the industry grapevine  and she immediately set her sights on the part of "Jane Burnham". As it turned out  she was the first to audition for director Sam Mendes; while he saw dozens of other actresses for the role  none delivered a more convincing "Jane". Still reeling from her sudden celebrity status  Birch plucked a handful of diverse projects from the deluge of post-"Beauty" scripts. Seeking an even edgier adolescent role  she appeared as a punk-rocker in the indie film The Smokers (2000)  then dropped the tough-girl pose to play the gentle "Empress Savina" in the live-action adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons (2000). She also signed up to play a teen hipster caught up in a post-high school identity crisis in Ghost World (2001) (based on the graphic novel)  and an English schoolgirl in the thriller The Hole (2001). Style-conscious and sophisticated beyond her years  Birch lives on her family's East L.A. ranch (where she recently finished high school through a computer-based correspondence course). She still hopes to try her hand at directing someday  but  for now  she's content to continue blossoming in front of the camera.,1982-03-11,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,0,0
nm0000304,Linda Blair,Linda Denise Blair,157,From the age of five  Linda Blair had to get used to the spotlight  first as a child model and then as an actress  when out of 600 applicants she was picked for the role of Regan  the possessed child  in L'esorcista (1973). Linda quickly rose to international fame  won the Golden Globe  and seemed to be set to take the Academy Award for that role  but when it leaked how some parts of the role were not performed by her (the demonic voice was dubbed by Mercedes McCambridge  and eight seconds of a stunt dummy were used) that dream broke  and with that disappointment probably came the first blow to what looked like the beginning of an A-list career.Over the next few years she had no trouble securing lead roles in a number of pictures  including the highly successful television films La ragazza del riformatorio (1974) (the #1 TV movie of that year) and Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (1975)  as well as the Exorcist sequel L'esorcista II - L'eretico (1977). However  when she was peer pressured into buying cocaine at the age of 18  it led to an arrest and subsequent sentencing to three years probation. The much-publicized drug bust caused Linda to be blacklisted in Hollywood  and her career was soon reduced to B-movies and occasional TV guest appearances only.Although her career never returned to its former glory  Linda proved to be a good sport about embracing the change  and out of the '80s emerged lead roles in two cult classics: the women-in-prison film Chained Heat (1983) and the femme fatale vigilante action film Savage Streets (1984). She continued acting in numerous films throughout the '80s and '90s  including the Exorcist spoof Riposseduta (1990). In 1997  she also took to the Broadway stage and starred as "Rizzo" in the revival of "Grease." She received widespread mainstream attention again in the 2000's with the theatrical re-release of the Exorcist  followed by a hosting job on the hit Fox Family TV series Scariest Places on Earth (2000)  which ran for six years and followed Linda as she visited notorious "haunted" locations around the world.Linda was born in St. Louis  Missouri  to Elinore  a real estate agent  and James  an executive headhunter. She has a brother  Jimmy  and a sister  Debbie. Linda has been a Hollywood icon for over 40 years  but it is her first love of animals that has ultimately taken center stage in her life. She now runs the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation  a non-profit 501C3 tax deductible organization dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating abused  neglected  and abandoned animals from the harsh streets of the Los Angeles area  as well as from the overcrowded and overwhelmed city and county animal shelters. She works and lives on the 2-acre rescue sanctuary full-time in California  which was featured on The Today Show in a segment titled "From Devil to Angel." Of course  she also makes frequent appearances at horror fan conventions to celebrate the legacy of L'esorcista (1973) .,1959-01-22,St. Louis  Missouri  USA,,,0,0

A giant of a man accompanied by an eloquent wit and booming  operatic voice  Brian was born in 1936 and grew up in the mining village of Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire. His father was a miner who wanted a better life for his son; Brian lost three uncles in the pit. At a young age  he displayed an acute talent for acting in school productions  but also had a penchant for boxing  a direction that would be short-lived.Working various blue-collar jobs from undertaker's assistant to plasterer  Brian managed to attend the Bristol Old Vic and was off and running.

nm0000318,Tim Burton,Timothy Walter Burton,180,Timothy Walter Burton was born in Burbank  California  to Jean Rae (Erickson)  who owned a cat-themed gift shop  and William Reed Burton  who worked for the Burbank Park and Recreation Department. He spent most of his childhood as a recluse  drawing cartoons  and watching old movies (he was especially fond of films with Vincent Price). When he was in the ninth grade  his artistic talent was recognized by a local garbage company  when he won a prize for an anti-litter poster he designed. The company placed this poster on all of their garbage trucks for a year. After graduating from high school  he attended California Institute of the Arts. Like so many others who graduated from that school  Burton's first job was as an animator for Disney.His early film career was fueled by almost unbelievable good luck  but it's his talent and originality that have kept him at the top of the Hollywood tree. He worked on such films as Red e Toby nemiciamici (1981) and Taron e la pentola magica (1985)  but had some creative differences with his colleagues. Nevertheless  Disney recognized his talent  and gave him the green light to make Vincent (1982)  an animated short about a boy who wanted to be just like Vincent Price. Narrated by Price himself  the short was a critical success and won several awards. Burton made a few other short films  including his first live-action film  Frankenweenie (1984). A half-hour long twist on the tale of Frankenstein  it was deemed inappropriate for children and wasn't released. But actor Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) saw Frankenweenie (1984)  and believed that Burton would be the right man to direct him in his first full-length feature film  Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985). The film was a surprise success  and Burton instantly became popular. However  many of the scripts that were offered to him after this were essentially just spin-offs of the film  and Burton wanted to do something new.For three years  he made no more films  until he was presented with the script for Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988). The script was wild and wasn't really about anything  but was filled with such artistic and quirky opportunities  Burton couldn't say no. Beetlejuice - Spiritello porcello (1988) was another big hit  and Burton's name in Hollywood was solidified. It was also his first film with actor Michael Keaton. Warner Bros. then entrusted him with Batman (1989)  a film based on the immensely popular comic book series of the same name. Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson  the film was the most financially successful film of the year and Burton's biggest box-office hit to date. Due to the fantastic success of his first three films  he was given the green light to make his next film  any kind of film he wanted. That film was Edward mani di forbice (1990)  one of his most emotional  esteemed and artistic films to date. Edward mani di forbice (1990) was also Burton's first film with actor Johnny Depp. Burton's next film was Batman - Il ritorno (1992)  and was darker and quirkier than the first one  and  while by no means a financial flop  many people felt somewhat disappointed by it. While working on Batman - Il ritorno (1992)  he also produced the popular Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  directed by former fellow Disney Animator Henry Selick. Burton reunited with Johnny Depp on the film Ed Wood (1994)  a film showered with critical acclaim  Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance in it  and it is very popular now  but flopped during its initial release. Burton's subsequent film  Mars Attacks! (1996)  had much more vibrant colors than his other films. Despite being directed by Burton and featuring all-star actors including Jack Nicholson  Glenn Close  Pierce Brosnan and Michael J. Fox  it received mediocre reviews and wasn't immensely popular at the box office  either.Burton returned to his darker and more artistic form with the film Il mistero di Sleepy Hollow (1999)  starring Johnny Depp  Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien. The film was praised for its art direction and was financially successful  redeeming Burton of the disappointment many had felt by Mars Attacks! (1996). His next film was Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001)  a remake of the classic of the same name. The film was panned by many critics but was still financially successful. While on the set of Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001)  Burton met Helena Bonham Carter  with whom he has two children. Burton directed the film Big Fish - Le storie di una vita incredibile (2003) - a much more conventional film than most of his others  it received a good deal of critical praise  although it disappointed some of his long-time fans who preferred the quirkiness of his other  earlier films. Despite the fluctuations in his career  Burton proved himself to be one of the most popular directors of the late 20th century. He directed Johnny Depp once again in La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005)  a film as quirky anything he's ever done.,1958-08-25,Burbank  California  USA,,,1,0

nm0000324,Barbara Carrera,Barbara Kingsbury,173,Barbara Carrera was born Barbara Kingsbury on December 31  1945 in Bluefields  Nicaragua. This stunning former model became best known for her screen performances playing a sinister femme fatale. In doing so  she has achieved minor cult status and has quite a loyal fanbase. The tall and tanned Carrera first cropped up in minor roles taking advantage of her exotic features in Il giorno del grande massacro (1975)  Embryo (1976) and L'isola del dottor Moreau (1977). She broke through with mainstream North American audiences playing Clay Basket in the miniseries Colorado (1978)  and Lucia Flavius Silva's mistress in the miniseries Masada (1981).She sizzled on screen with Armand Assante as the sexy yet evil doctor in Io  la giuria (1982)  was the love interest of Texas Ranger Chuck Norris in Una magnum per McQuade (1983)  and gave her best role to date as assassin Fatima Blush opposite Sean Connery in Mai dire mai (1983)  and then as Emma Forsayth in the miniseries Emma: la regina dei Mari del Sud (1988). In 1985-86  she played the role of business executive Angelica Nero on the primetime soap opera Dallas (1978). Carrera has most recently been seen guest starring on the popular television series That '70s Show (1998) and Giudice Amy (1999).,1945-12-31,Bluefields  Nicaragua,,,3,0
nm0000325,David Caruso,David Stephen Caruso,183,His low-keyed intensity  deep-voiced somberness  pale skin  puffy-eyed baby face and crop of carrot-red hair are all obvious and intriguing trademarks of TV star David Caruso. A hugely popular item in the 1990s as a result of a smash crime series  he got way too caught up in all the hoopla surrounding him. Those working with him on the innovative cop series were not exactly unhappy when he decided to abandon ship after only one season in order to pursue movie star fame. Despite his own predictions  the show prospered quite well after the loss of his focal character...but it would be a major understatement to state that Caruso did not fare as well.TV to film crossover fame is tricky and David did not have the right formula to pull it off. Bad judgment calls  bad publicity after his departure from his TV series  a couple of poor film vehicles  and virtual unemployment in its wake eventually led him back to the small screen again a somewhat humbler person. Not many are given a second chance but Caruso  the enigmatic talent that he is  found gold a second time as (again) a wan  brooding lead in a hip  unconventional cop series.David Stephen Caruso was born in Forest Hills  Queens  New York  the son of Charles Caruso  a magazine and newspaper editor  and Joan  a librarian. The Irish Catholic youngster attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs and then Archbishop Molloy High School  both in Queens.Following high school graduation in 1974  he toyed with some commercial work. A few years later he began to make a slight dent in films. He first appeared in I ragazzi dell'accademia militare (1980) and Horror - Caccia ai terrestri (1980)  which led to a succession of secondary roles in such 80s movies as Ufficiale e gentiluomo (1982)  Rambo (1982) (as a sheriff's deputy)  Ladro di donne (1984)  Blue City (1986)  China Girl (1987) and I gemelli (1988). But the break into full-fledged TV stardom proved elusive. It was argued that the thin and lanky actor was not handsome enough to become a leading man in film and didn't have the charisma credentials to carry a big movie.Making his unbilled debut in a daytime episode of "Ryan's Hope"  TV proved to be a more inviting medium and police stories seemed to be the name of the game for him. He had a strong recurring role as a gang leader on Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) and showed to good advantage in the series Crime Story (1986). This sudden notoriety on police TV gave way to some even stronger stuff in streetwise film crimers such as King of New York (1990) as a cop gone bad  and Lo sbirro  il boss e la bionda (1993)  in which he earned excellent marks as a cynical urban cop. But his star-making role came via TV and his portrayal of Detective John Kelly the critically-acclaimed series New York Police Department (1993). Audience adoration was immediate.His volatile but principled character on the gritty  boldly-written  unconventional show earned him impressive and sexy notices with a Golden Globe Award and Emmy nomination placed in his hands. Confident now that he could be a magnetic force in front of a movie camera  stories began to circulate that the instant fame had gone to his head  that he was moody  demanding and difficult on the set  and that he was quickly alienating not only his co-stars but the show's directors and writers.Ready to prove all those naysayers wrong about his chances in film  Caruso made tabloid headlines when he announced his decision to leave the highly-rated show after only one season (and only four episodes into the second season) to pursue film stardom. Rumors also bounced around that he left following unresolved salary negotiations. For whatever reason  he wasted no time in scouting out movie vehicles for himself. Again  he focused on his specialty -- crime thrillers. The first  Il bacio della morte (1995)  in which he played a petty thief trying to go straight  did not go over well box-office-wise despite its good reviews  and the second  Jade (1995)  in which he portrayed a homicide detective  was a grisly  unappetizing thriller that was given the thumbs down almost immediately. As a comeuppance for coming up short  he was nominated for the dubious "Razzie" award as the "Worst New Star" of those two films. With no movie releases at all in 1996  by the time Cold Around the Heart (1997) was released  in which he played a jewel thief who is betrayed by his sexy partner-in-crime (Kelly Lynch)  the TV star had lost all of his movie star momentum.In 1997  Caruso made an inauspicious return to the small screen as the placid title prosecutor Michael Hayes indaga (1997)  a law series  but it was a very short-lived experience. Audiences had become fickle and indifferent to his "heralded comeback". Finding a serious lack of offers  he returned to supporting others in films such as Russell Crowe in Rapimento e riscatto (2000)  and copped a couple of leads for himself in such low-budgeted films as Session 9 (2001) and the Canadian film Black Point (2002).But in 2002  he found TV magic once again behind a badge as Lt. Horatio Caine in the popular CSI spin-off series CSI: Miami (2002). Strongly anchoring the show  which focuses more on crime methodology and whodunnit twists than character development  Caruso has nevertheless earned cult fame for his slick demeanor and deliberately slow speech patterns  reminding one of William Shatner's heady  methodical approach to Captain Kirk. Known for his deep  dry tones and parade of droll one-liners  many of which include him slipping on his dark shades during mid-sentence  he has been the subject of many a late-nite parody and satire.A difficult interviewee who has admitted to keeping his monumental ego in check since his return to TV  he has been little seen since the "Miami" series ended in 2012 after ten season. David has been married and divorced three times  which includes a brief 1980s union to actress Rachel Ticotin. He has a daughter  Greta  from that union. On the sly  Caruso was a co-owner of now long-defunct Steam  a clothing and furniture store in Miami  Florida. He and his current girlfriend (since 2005)  Liza Marquez  have two children -- son Marquez Anthony and and daughter  Paloma Raquel.,1956-01-07,Forest Hills  New York  USA,,,3,1

However  it was her portrayal of sexually liberated public relations executive Samantha Jones on the HBO sitcom Sex and the City (1998) and its two feature film follow-ups that brought her worldwide attention  and gained her five Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations including winning the 2002 Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.,1956-08-21,Liverpool  England  UK,,,2,0

His parents both came from prominent families  and his grandfathers were artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase and admiral Miles Browning. His recent ancestry includes English  Scottish  Irish  and Danish.His grandmother gave him the nickname "Chevy" when he was two years old.

All his films show his talent for deadpan comedy. Sadly  his career generally worsened throughout the nineties  starring in disappointments such as the mediocre Avventure di un uomo invisibile (1992)  and Poliziotti a domicilio (1994). More recently  Community (2009) marked a return for him  as he played a regular role for the first four seasons.,1943-10-08,New York City  New York  USA,,,2,3
nm0000334,Yun-Fat Chow,Chow Yun Fat,186,Chow Yun Fat is a charismatic  athletically built and energetic Asian-born film star who first came to the attention of western audiences via his roles in the high-octane/blazing guns action films of maverick HK director John Woo.Chow was born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma  part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong  near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady  and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow's family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973  Chow attended a casting call for TVB  a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style  Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However  his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series Shang Hai tan (1980).In 1985  Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in Dang doi lai ming (1984). With these accolades  Chow came to the attention of Woo  who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film A Better Tomorrow (1986) (aka "A Better Tomorrow"). The rest  as they say  is history. The film was an enormous commercial success  and Chow's influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a "Mark Coat " as they became known--a long  heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong's hot and humid climate).Further hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow's popularity even higher  and fans all over the world flocked to see A Better Tomorrow II (1987) (aka "A Better Tomorrow 2")  The Killer (1989) (aka "The Killer")  and Hard Boiled (1992) (aka "Hard Boiled"). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre  Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in Costretti ad uccidere (1998) with Mira Sorvino  The Corruptor - Indagine a Chinatown (1999) with Mark Wahlberg  and  for a change of pace  in the often-filmed romantic tale of Anna and the King (1999).Chow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic La tigre e il dragone (2000) (aka "Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon"). His wide appeal can be seen in his "boy next door" type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer. A highly entertaining and gifted actor with dynamic on-screen presence  Chow continues to remain in strong demand in many film markets.,1955-05-18,Lamma Island  Hong Kong,,,1,0

nm0000337,Rachael Leigh Cook,Rachael Leigh Cook,157,Minneapolis native Rachael Leigh Cook began her career as a model at the tender age of 10  gracing Milk-Bone(R) boxes and Target(R) ads nationwide in the USA. She also appeared in a now-famous (in the USA) anti-drug TV spot in which  armed with a frying pan  she bashed her way through a kitchen to show the disastrous effects of heroin. At 14  her modeling agency sent her to read for a short film (26 Summer Street (1996)) and changed the course of her young life--from that moment on  Cook was hooked on acting. When she reached L.A. later that year  Cook bypassed the wannabe stage and nailed her first audition (for the part of a budding entrepreneur in Il club delle baby sitter (1995)). She returned to theaters three months later in the Jonathan Taylor Thomas vehicle Le avventure di Tom Sawyer e Huck Finn (1995)  then filled her calendar with appearances in independent and made-for-TV movies. She divided her time between Minneapolis and Tinseltown  shuttling from school events to movie shoots with her mother in tow. Cook's starlet status crystallized in 1999  when she starred opposite Freddie Prinze Jr. in the Pygmalion retelling Kiss Me (1999). Her on-screen transformation from ugly duckling to ravishing beauty scored several teen-oriented awards and made Cook a hot commodity in Hollywood. She signed for a handful of plum follow-up roles  including a troubled adolescent in Sylvester Stallone's La vendetta di Carter (2000)  a frontier gal in Texas Rangers (2001)  and the caterwauling lead in the live-action version of Josie and the Pussycats (2001).

nm0000343,David Cronenberg,David Paul Cronenberg,175,David Cronenberg  also known as the King of Venereal Horror or the Baron of Blood  was born in Toronto  Ontario  Canada  in 1943. His father  Milton Cronenberg  was a journalist and editor  and his mother  Esther (Sumberg)  was a piano player. After showing an inclination for literature at an early age (he wrote and published eerie short stories  thus following his father's path) and for music (playing classical guitar until he was 12)  Cronenberg graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Literature after switching from the science department. He reached the cult status of horror-meister with the gore-filled  modern-vampire variations of Il demone sotto la pelle (1975) and Rabid - Sete di sangue (1977)  following an experimental apprenticeship in independent film-making and in Canadian television programs.Cronenberg gained popularity with the head-exploding  telepathy-based Scanners (1981) after the release of the much underrated  controversial  and autobiographical Brood - La covata malefica (1979). Cronenberg become a sort of a mass media guru with Videodrome (1983)  a shocking investigation of the hazards of reality-morphing television and a prophetic critique of contemporary aesthetics. The issues of tech-induced mutation of the human body and topics of the prominent dichotomy between body and mind were back again in La zona morta (1983) and La mosca (1986)  both bright examples of a personal film-making identity  even if both films are based on mass-entertainment materials: the first being a rendition of a Stephen King best-seller  the latter a remake of a famous American horror movie.With Inseparabili (1988) and Il pasto nudo (1991)  the Canadian director  no more a mere genre movie-maker but a fully realized auteur  got the acclaim of international critics. Such profound statements on modern humanity and ever-changing society are prominent in the provocative Crash (1996) and in the virtual reality essay of eXistenZ (1999)  both of which well fared at the Cannes and Berlin Film Festivals. In the last two film projects Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005)  Cronenberg avoids expressing his teratologic and oniric expressionism in favor of a more psychological exploration of human contradictions and idiosyncrasies.,1943-03-15,Toronto  Ontario  Canada,,,1,4

Forming part of the extensive Crosby family dynasty  this striking leading actress  daughter of entertainer Dennis Crosby  has appeared in film and television since the early 1980s. A photo spread in a 1979 issue of Playboy magazine and a role in the soap opera Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) in 1980 allowed Denise to break through to stardom. She had a small role in 48 ore (1982)  playing the villain's girlfriend  and parts in Sulle orme della pantera rosa (1982) and Pantera rosa - Il mistero Clouseau (1983) (both critically unsuccessful).

In 1989  she played the mother of a dead toddler who was brought back to life through an ancient curse in Stephen King's somewhat hokey horror novel film adaptation Cimitero vivente (1989).

There were also roles in Sotto controllo (1994)  Mutant Species (1995)  Premonizione omicida (1995) and Morte alla Casa Bianca (1997). More high-profile work arrived in the form of a small role in Jackie Brown (1997)  playing a public defender  and a sizable part as a pregnant mother in the hit disaster movie Deep Impact (1998). She gained recognition as a "Star Trek" fan by producing and presenting Trekkies (1997) and its sequel Trekkies 2 (2004).Since 2000  Denise has appeared on television in guest roles on X-Files (1993)  JAG - Avvocati in divisa (1995)  The Agency (2001)  Codice Matrix (2003)  Eyes (2005) and Dexter (2006).

Rebecca's paternal grandfather was English  and she also has German  French  and other English  ancestry.After Richard De Mornay's untimely death  Rebecca's mother moved her and her half-brother Peter from northern California to Europe  where she was raised primarily in England and Austria.

nm0000368,Laura Dern,Laura Elizabeth Dern,178,Laura Dern was born on February 10  1967 in Los Angeles  the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd. Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy  and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result.Her parents' background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors  her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents  she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism  and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn't help - even before her teens  she had achieved most of her impressive 5' 10" height  was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips)  had huge feet and a slouching posture  and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.The first success for the young Dern came in 1980  with a role in Adrian Lyne's A donne con gli amici (1980)  a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts  or parts in small movies  such as Ladies and Gentlemen  the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Teachers (1984)  as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen  which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in "The Fabulous Stains"). Her next roles  as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Dietro la maschera (1985)  and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in La prima volta (1985)  gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch's acclaimed Velluto blu (1986)  but it was four years before her next notable film  and this was the bizarre Cuore selvaggio (1990)  also directed by Lynch.The following year  Dern starred in Rosa Scompiglio e i suoi amanti (1991)  which would become her signature performance  as a sexually-precocious  free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance  and so did her mother and co-star  Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen  often in smaller  highly-regarded human dramas such as Cielo d'ottobre (1999)  Mi chiamo Sam (2001) and I giochi dei grandi (2004)  although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001)  or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994)  as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian.Dern's pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty  but this doesn't prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering  an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in La storia di Ruth - Donna americana (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today.Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams  Renny Harlin  Kyle MacLachlan  Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton  Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career  Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson  the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.,1967-02-10,Saint John's Health Center  Santa Monica  Los Angeles County  California  USA,,,1,2

nm0000381,Anthony Edwards,Anthony Charles Edwards,188,Anthony Edwards was born in Santa Barbara  California  on July 19  1962  to a well-blended family. He is the youngest of five children  and the son of Erika Kem (Weber)  a landscape painter and artist  and Peter Edwards  an architect. His mother was of German descent  and his father was of English  Irish  Scottish  and Spanish-Mexican ancestry.Edwards's parents encouraged him to act at age 16  which eventually led him to attending a summer workshop in London before graduating from high school. Returning to the United States  Edwards worked in commercials  jobs that helped him pay his education at The University of Southern California  where he studied acting. However  he dropped out of college and  in that same year  he had a small role in the movie Fuori di testa (1982)  starring Sean Penn. The movie was a box office smash and Edwards was looking forward to doing more films. His first movie role was that of teen-aged "John Muldowney" in Dragster: vivere a 300 all'ora (1983) and his first starring role as nerdy "Gilbert Lowell"  in La rivincita dei nerds (1984).Edwards didn't need to worry about being typecast as a socially-challenged loser. After starring in Sacco a pelo a tre piazze (1985) and Toccato! (1985)  he landed another big-time successful movie Top Gun (1986)  in which he played Tom Cruise's ill-fated easy-going navigator/best friend  Lt. Nick "Goose" Bradshaw. As Cruise rode Top Gun (1986) into the Hollywood stratosphere  Edwards also found his flight to stardom  at the same time. After Top Gun (1986)  he reprised his role as Gilbert in the movie La rivincita dei nerds II (1987)  before he starred in Brivido d'estate (1987). He also starred in Mr. North (1988)  and Soluzione finale (1988)  although they weren't too successful.Edwards began working in TV movies and continued to star in more box office movies such as Hawks (1988)  Commissione d'esame (1989)  Pronti a tutto (1990)  Cimitero vivente 2 (1992)  Omicidi dal passato (1992) and I delitti di New Orleans (1992). The '90s won Edwards his best reviews for his recurring role of the quirky "bubble man" Mike Monroe on the popular television series Un medico fra gli orsi (1990). He was nominated for a Cable Ace Award in HBO's Sexual Healing (1993)  and the following year  he starred in Il fantasma di Charlie (1995)  before he played law clerk "Clint Von Hooser" in the John Grisham movie Il cliente (1994). This led to his most prominent role  as easy-going charismatic physician "Dr. Mark Greene" on the very popular TV series E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994).For his work on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994)  he was nominated for an Emmy Award four times For Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series  but has never won. However  he has won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-in-a-TV-Series  and was nominated four times  and also has two Screen Actor's Guild Awards. Prior to playing Dr. Greene  he also played bank breaker turned cold-blooded killer  "Dick Hickock" in the TV movie remake of Truman Capote's A sangue freddo (1996)  which was the best TV movie of the 1996-97 season. During Edwards' hiatus on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994)  he went back to the box office circuit to star and to produce the movie Non per sport... ma per amore (1999)  a complex movie which wasn't a big hit. Edwards  once again  returned to the set of E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994)  and this time  he signed up for a salary that almost no actor could be paid  so his decision was to stay on the show for 3 more years and possibly to save the money in order to spend a lot of family time and to work on directing later.His first big roles after E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994) were that of "Brains" in the movie Thunderbirds (2004)  and as "Jim Paretta" in The Forgotten (2004). In the many years that he starred on E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994)  that show gave him more success in working on and off the set. Also  it gave him a spiritual blessing that so many popular actors have had over the years.,1962-07-19,Santa Barbara  California  USA,,,0,4

nm0000384,Danny Elfman,Daniel Robert Elfman,178,As Danny Elfman was growing up in the Los Angeles area  he was largely unaware of his talent for composing. It wasn't until the early 1970s that Danny and his older brother Richard Elfman started a musical troupe while in Paris; the group "Mystic Knights of Oingo-Boingo" was created for Richard's directorial debut  Forbidden Zone (1980) (now considered a cult classic by Elfman fans). The group's name went through many incarnations over the years  beginning with "The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo" and eventually just Oingo Boingo. While continuing to compose eclectic  intelligent rock music for his L.A.-based band (some of which had been used in various film soundtracks  e.g. La donna esplosiva (1985))  Danny formed a friendship with young director Tim Burton  who was then a fan of Oingo Boingo. Danny went on to score the soundtrack of Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)  Danny's first orchestral film score. The Elfman-Burton partnership continued (most notably through the hugely-successful "Batman" flicks) and opened doors of opportunity for Danny  who has been referred to as "Hollywood's hottest film composer".,1953-05-29,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,1,2
nm0000385,Sam Elliott,Samuel Pack Elliott,188,Tall  thin  wiry Sam Elliott is the classic picture of the American cowboy. Elliott began his acting career on the stage and his film debut was in Butch Cassidy (1969). Although his future wife  Katharine Ross co-starred in the film  the two did not meet until they filmed Il testamento (1978) Together. Over the years there would be few opportunities to act in feature westerns  but it would be television that gave him that opportunity  in The Sacketts (1979)  Ombre a cavallo (1982) and Yellow Rose (1983)  among others. He would also work in non-westerns  usually as a tough guy  as in Il bagnino (1976) and Il duro del Road House (1989). In the 1990s  Elliott was back on the western trail  playing everyone from Brig. Gen. John Buford in the film Gettysburg (1993) to Wild Bill Hickok in the made-for-TV movie Buffalo Girls (1995).

He is of mostly English  Scottish  and Irish ancestry.Everett grew up in privileged circumstances  but the wry  sometimes arrogant  intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven  he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in Scotland  performing in such productions as 'Don Juan' and 'Heartbreak House'.In 1984 Everett successfully filmed a lead role in Another Country - La scelta (1984)  which he had performed earlier on stage and shot to international attention  becoming one of England's hottest new star. But again the wickedly sharp and suave rebel doused his own fire by clashing with the press and even with his own fans. In 1989  Everett openly declared his own homosexuality. His career revitalized as Julia Roberts' gay confidante in Il matrimonio del mio migliore amico (1997)  and he has continued to impress notably in the classics area with Shakespeare in Love (1998) (as Christopher Marlowe)  Un marito ideale (1999) and Sogno di una notte di mezza estate (1999) (as Oberon). Lately he has enhanced both films with his royal portrayals in Uccidere il re (2003) and Stage Beauty (2004)  and television with his effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock Holmes ed il caso della calza di seta (2004). His predilection for smug and smarmy villains of late such as the cartoonish Dr. Claw in Inspector Gadget (1999) has extended into voice animation with his "unprincely" Prince Charming character in Shrek 2 (2004).,1959-05-29,Burnham Deepdale  Norfolk  England  UK,,,0,0

Frakes  a professor. His parents moved with Jonathan and his younger brother Daniel to Bethlehem in eastern Pennsylvania. There  his father taught English at Lehigh University  where he held the Fairchild chair in American Literature until his passing in 2002. Frakes is of German  and some English  ancestry.While growing up Jonathan was introduced to jazz by his father and started playing the trombone when he was in fourth grade. As a child Jonathan was always friendly  funny and somewhat of an actor according to a childhood friend. In high school he played in the band and ran track. He graduated from Liberty High in Bethlehem in 1970. The day after he graduated he started classes at Pennsylvania State University  enrolling as a psychology major. The next summer he worked as an usher for the local theater and observed his peers thoroughly enjoying acting. He was motivated to switch his major to theater arts and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1974. He then moved to Boston to attain his masters degree from Harvard University by 1976.At this point he decided to move to New York City and try to make it as an actor. The roles did not come easily so he had to take side jobs  such as a waiter  a furniture mover (where he injured up his back)  and a stint as Captain America for Marvel Comics. Meanwhile he won roles in the Broadway musical "Shenandoah" and on the soap opera The Doctors (1969) as Vietnam veteran Tom Carroll from 1977 to 1978. At his agent's urging Jonathan moved to Los Angeles in late 1978 to try his hand at television guest appearances. He guest-starred on several of the big prime-time shows of the time  including Charlie's Angels (1976)  Fantasilandia (1977)  Barnaby Jones (1973)  Quincy (1976)  Autostop per il cielo (1984)  Una famiglia americana (1972)  and Hazzard (1979).During the 1980s Jonathan landed a starring role in a prime-time soap opera  Il profumo del potere (1983)  which had spun off a successful miniseries of the same name. However the show did not take off with the viewers and was soon canceled. He went back to guest appearances for two more years until he got the part of Stanley Hazard in the Civil War epic Nord e sud (1985). After spending more than six months filming all over the southern United States  he and his co-star  Genie Francis  fell in love (he had met her three years before when they co-starred in Il profumo del potere (1983)). During that time he and Genie didn't have much to do with each other  other than his making fun of her hair  according to her. However three years later they were an item.In early 1987 Jonathan went to an audition for a new television series at the urging of his soon-to-be wife and her family. After six weeks  and seven auditions  he won the role that would bring him worldwide fame: that of Commander William Riker on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). It was at this time  he and Genie announced their engagement. They would have to postpone their wedding twice because of his job but were finally married in the first-season hiatus on May 28  1988. All of his new co-stars attended the wedding  along with Star Trek (1966) creator Gene Roddenberry. During the seven years Frakes starred on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)  he not only acted but discovered that he had a talent for directing. He helmed eight episodes in all and was invited to direct on the Next Generation spin-offs  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Star Trek: Voyager (1995).The day after his 42nd birthday  on August 20  his son  Jameson Ivor Frakes  was born. Jameson is named after both his grandfathers  the late James Frakes and the late actor Ivor Francis  Genie's father. During this time Jonathan actually turned down work  preferring to stay at home and raise his son with his wife. For the next two years he did a few guest appearances on television.In 1996 it was announced that he was to be the director of the next Star Trek film  Primo contatto (1996). He received critical praise for his work on the film and it became the highest-grossing entry of the franchise to date. He formed a production company  Goepp Circle Productions  named after the street he lived on in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania. Just two days after his ninth wedding anniversary in 1997  Elizabeth Francis Frakes was born. Sadly just two weeks prior Jonathan's brother  Daniel  passed away from pancreatic cancer. In 1998 he was asked to direct the ninth Star Trek film  Star Trek - L'insurrezione (1998).

nm0000410,Stephen Fry,Stephen John Fry,195,Writer  actor  comedian  doer of good works  excellent good friend to the famous and not  Fry lives in his London SW1 flat and his Norfolk house when not traveling. Famous for his public declaration of celibacy in the "Tatler" back in the 1980s  Emma Thompson has characterised her friend as "90 percent gay  10 percent other."Stephen Fry was born in Hampstead  London  to Marianne Eve (Newman) and Alan Fry  a physicist and inventor. His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants  while his father's family was of English background. He grew up in Norfolk and attended Uppingham School and Stout's Hill. After his notorious three months in Pucklechurch prison for credit card fraud  he attended Queens College  Cambridge in 1979  finishing with a 2:1 in English in 1981/2. While at Cambridge  he was a member of the Cherubs drinking club  and Footlights with Thompson  Tony Slattery  Martin Bergman  and Hugh Laurie (to whom he was introduced by E.T.). His prolific writing partnership with Laurie began in 1981 with resulting Footlights revues for (among others) Mayweek  Edinburgh Festival  and a three month tour of Australia. In 1984  Fry was engaged to do the rewrite of the Noel Gay musical "Me and My Girl " which made him a millionaire before the age of 30. It also earned him a nomination for a Tony award in 1987. (Sidenote: It was upon SF's suggestion that Emma Thompson landed a leading role in the London cast of this show.) Throughout the 1980s  Fry did a huge amount of television and radio work  as well as writing for newspapers (e.g. a weekly column in the "Daily Telegraph") and magazines (e.g. articles for "Arena"). He is probably best known for his television roles in Blackadder II (1986) and Jeeves and Wooster (1990).His support of the Terence Higgins Trust through events such as the first "Hysteria" benefit  as well as numerous other charity efforts  are probably those works of which he is most proud. Fry's acting career has not been limited to films and television. He had successful runs in Alan Bennett's "Forty Years On " Simon Gray's "The Common Pursuit" with John Sessions  Rik Mayall  John Gordon Sinclair  and others. Michael Frayn's "Look Look" and Gray's "Cell Mates" were less successful for both Fry and their playwrights  the latter not helped by his walking out of the play after only a couple of weeks. Fry has published four novels as well as a collection of his radio and journalistic miscellanea. He has recorded audiotapes of his novels (an unabridged version of "The Liar" was released in 1995)  as well as many other works for both adults and children.,1957-08-24,Hampstead  London  England  UK,,,0,0

nm0000424,Hugh Grant,Hugh John Mungo Grant,180,Hugh Grant  one of Britain's best known faces  has been equally entertaining on-screen as well as in real life  and has had enough sense of humor to survive a media frenzy. He is known for his roles in Quattro matrimoni e un funerale (1994)  with Andie MacDowell  Notting Hill (1999)  opposite Julia Roberts  and Scrivimi una canzone (2007)  opposite Drew Barrymore  among his other works.He was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9  1960  in Hammersmith  London  United Kingdom.

nm0000465,Ron Jeremy,Ronald Jeremy Hyatt,171,Since the demise of the legendary John Holmes in March 1988  the short  mustachioed  heavyset Ron Jeremy has assumed the mantle as the number one U.S. male star of adult cinema. However  don't confuse Ron with the similar looking mustachioed 1970/'80s adult film star  Harry Reems  who has long since retired from the adult film industry. Portly Ron is not blessed with film star looks and a chiseled six-pack (a decidedly unchiseled 12- or 18-pack would be more like it) - his appeal and talents lie in other areas (which happen to be in his long 'member' measuring nearly 10 inches  erect!) and his "regular guy" appearance and amazing endurance in front of the camera have undoubtedly contributed to his phenomenal success in an industry notorious for dumping those men who can't perform on cue.He's also one of the very few adult film stars to make the jump into mainstream cinema  with minor appearances in movies such as Trappola criminale (2000)  Detroit Rock City (1999) and The Boondock Saints - Giustizia finale (1999). He was born Ron Jeremy Hyatt on March 12  1953  in New York City and graduated from Cardozo High School (Queens  NY) in 1971  attained a masters degree from Queens College and then commenced special educational teaching in the New York City area. In 1978  a girlfriend sent his photo off to "Playgirl" magazine for appearance in its "Boy Next Door" pages. It was an understatement to say that Ron was deluged with female fan mail  and letters of interest from adult filmmakers!Beginning in 1979  he has appeared in well over 800 adult feature films including Inside Seka (1980)  Debbie Does Dallas Part II (1981)  Terms of Endowment (1986) Lust of Blackula (1987)  21 Hump Street (1988) and Natural Born Thrillers (1994). At 50+ years of age  the charismatic and often comedic Ron Jeremy is still appearing in front of the camera in adult films and he's definitely attained iconic status in the adult entertainment industry and beyond.,1953-03-12,Long Island  New York  USA,,,0,0

nm0000469,James Earl Jones,James Earl Jones,187,Widely regarded as the one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native USA and internationally  James Earl Jones was born on January 17  1931 in Arkabutla  Mississippi. At an early age  he started to take dramatic lessons to calm himself down. It appeared to work as he has since starred in many films over a 40-year period  beginning with the Stanley Kubrick classic Il dottor Stranamore - Ovvero: come ho imparato a non preoccuparmi e ad amare la bomba (1964). For several movie fans  he is probably best known for his role as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy (due to his contribution for the voice of the role  as the man in the Darth Vader suit was David Prowse  whose voice was dubbed because of his British West Country accent). In his brilliant course of memorable performances  among others  he has also appeared on the animated series I Simpson (1989) three times and played Mufasa both in The Lion King (1994) and Il Re Leone (2019)  while he returned too as the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith (2005) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016).,1931-01-17,Arkabutla  Mississippi  USA,,,1,1

nm0000473,Diane Keaton,Diane Hall,169,Diane Keaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles  California  to Dorothy Deanne (Keaton)  an amateur photographer  and John Newton Ignatius "Jack" Hall  a civil engineer and real estate broker. She studied Drama at Santa Ana College  before dropping out in favor of the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. After appearing in summer stock for several months  she got her first major stage role in the Broadway rock musical "Hair". As understudy to the lead  she gained attention by not removing any of her clothing. In 1968  Woody Allen cast her in his Broadway play "Play It Again  Sam " which had a successful run. It was during this time that she became involved with Allen and appeared in a number of his films. The first one was Provaci ancora  Sam (1972)  the screen adaptation of the stage play. That same year Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Kay in the Oscar-winning Il padrino (1972)  and she was on her way to stardom. She reprized that role in the film's first sequel  Il padrino - Parte II (1974). She then appeared with Allen again in Il dormiglione (1973) and Amore e guerra (1975).In 1977  she broke away from her comedy image to appear in the chilling In cerca di Mr. Goodbar (1977)  which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was the same year that she appeared in what many regard as her best performance  in the title role of Io e Annie (1977)  which Allen wrote specifically for her (her real last name is Hall  and her nickname is Annie)  and what an impact she made. She won the Oscar and the British Award for Best Actress  and Allen won the Directors Award from the DGA. She started a fashion trend with her unisex clothes and was the poster girl for a lot of young males. Her mannerisms and awkward speech became almost a national craze. The question being asked  though  was  "Is she just a lightweight playing herself  or is there more depth to her personality?" For whatever reason  she appeared in but one film a year for the next two years and those films were by Allen. When they broke up she was next involved with Warren Beatty and appeared in his film Reds (1981)  as the bohemian female journalist Louise Bryant. For her performance  she received nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. For the rest of the 1980s she appeared infrequently in films but won nominations in three of them. Attempting to break the typecasting she had fallen into  she took on the role of a confused  somewhat naive woman who becomes involved with Middle Eastern terrorists in La tamburina (1984). To offset her lack of movie work  Diane began directing. She directed the documentary Heaven (1987)  as well as some music videos. For television she directed an episode of the popular  but strange  I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990).In the 1990s  she began to get more mature roles  though she reprized the role of Kay Corleone in the third "Godfather" epic  Il padrino - Parte III (1990). She appeared as the wife of Steve Martin in the hit Il padre della sposa (1991) and again in Il padre della sposa 2 (1995). In 1993 she once again teamed with Woody Allen in Misterioso omicidio a Manhattan (1993)  which was well received. In 1995 she received high marks for Eroi di tutti i giorni (1995)  her first major feature as a director.,1946-01-05,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,0,0

(1962)  and in the following few years had bit roles in several television shows  until he landed the role that would catapult his career in ways he could never have imagined  as Ensign Pavel Chekov in Star Trek's Original Series (Star Trek (1966)). He went on to reprise that role in all 7 of the original Star Trek movies (The 7th movie  Generazioni (1994) was mostly ST: The Next Generation  but had the original series section at the beginning  and Kirk at the end)  as well as voicing the same character in several of the video games.

Since it was Fan-Made (and to avoid violating studio rights) they couldn't use the Star Trek Character's names  like Uhura or Chekov  so they simply called him 'The Admiral'.

Linklater III. Richard was among the first and most successful talents to emerge during the American independent film renaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period  Linklater's work explored what he dubbed "the youth rebellion continuum " focusing in fine detail on generational rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced  illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young actors into the Hollywood firmament.

nm0000517,Terrence Malick,Terrence Frederick Malick,170,Terrence Malick was born in Ottawa  Illinois. His family subsequently lived in Oklahoma and he went to school in Austin  Texas. He did his undergraduate work at Harvard  graduating summa cum laude with a degree in philosophy in 1965.A member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society  he attended Magdalen College  Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship  but did not finish his thesis on Martin Heidegger  allegedly because of a disagreement with his advisor. Returning to the States  he taught philosophy at M.I.T. and published a translation of Heidegger's "Vom Wesen des Grundes" as "The Essence of Reasons". Malick did not get his PhD in philosophy: Instead  he attended the American Film Institute Conservatory in its inaugural year (1969)  taking a Masters of Fine Arts degree in film-making. His masters thesis was the seventeen-minute comedy short Lanton Mills (1969)  which starred Warren Oates and Harry Dean Stanton. Malick himself acted in the short.At A.F.I.  Malick made a lasting association with Jack Fisk  who would establish himself as an Oscar-nominated art director and production designer and serve as art director on all of Malick's films. He also picked up Mike Medavoy as an agent  who got Malick work doctoring scripts and marketed his original ones. He wrote the screenplay for the 1972 Alan Arkin trucker movie Deadhead Miles (1972)  which was many miles from Harvard let along Oxford  and for the 1972 Paul Newman-Lee Marvin contemporary oater Per una manciata di soldi... (1972)  another departure from fields of academia. "Deadhead Miles" was dumped by Paramount as unreleasable and "Pocket Money"  despite being headlined by two Top Ten Box Office stars  flopped. It was an inauspicious start to a legendary career  but it influenced Malick to begin directing his own scripts.His first two films were the now critically acclaimed La rabbia giovane (1973) and I giorni del cielo (1978). He then took a self-imposed retirement of nearly two decades from film-making before lensing his 1998 adaptation of James Jones's La sottile linea rossa (1998)  which was nominated for 7 Academy Awards  including nods for Malick for directing and adapted screenplay.Adopting a Kubrickian pace of movie-making  he directed The New World - Il nuovo mondo (2005) and the autobiographical The Tree of Life (2011) with gaps of only seven and six years  respectively  between release. However  he reportedly was working on ideas for "The Tree of Life" since the late 70s  including exposing footage that found its way into his finished film.In an unprecedented burst of productivity  he shot his next four films  To the Wonder (2012)  Knight of Cups (2015)  an as-yet unnamed drama and the cosmic documentary Voyage of Time: Life's Journey (2016) back-to-back during and immediately after completing the long editing process of "Tree of Life".

She was adopted by Canadian-born parents  Noreen Eloise (Nickleson)  a nurse from Ontario  and The Rev. Vernon Weir McDormand  a Disciples of Christ minister from Nova Scotia  who raised her in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. She earned her B.A. in Theater from Bethany College in 1979 and her MFA from Yale in 1982.

She soon obtained prominent roles in movies as well  first starring in Blood Simple - Sangue facile (1984)  in which she worked with filmmaker Joel Coen  whom she married that year. She frequently collaborated with Coen and his brother Ethan Coen in their films.McDormand's skilled and versatile acting has been recognized by both the critics and the Academy and  in addition to many critics' awards  she has been nominated for an Academy Award five times - Supporting in Mississippi Burning - Le radici dell'odio (1988)  Quasi famosi (2000)  and North Country - Storia di Josey (2005)  and Lead in Fargo (1996) and Tre manifesti a Ebbing  Missouri (2017)  winning the Oscar for the latter two.

nm0000532,Malcolm McDowell,Malcolm John Taylor,174,Malcolm John Taylor was born on June 13  1943 in Leeds  England  to working-class parents Edna (McDowell)  a hotelier  and Charles Taylor  a publican. His father was an alcoholic. Malcolm hated his parents' ways. His father was keen to send his son to private school to give him a good start in life  so Malcolm was packed off to boarding school at age 11. He attended the Tunbridge Boarding School and the Cannock House School in Eltham  Kent. At school  he was beaten with the slipper or cane every Monday for his wayward behavior. Whilst at school  he decided that he wanted to become an actor; it was also around this time that his love for race cars began. He attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) to study acting. Meanwhile  he worked at his parents' pub but lost his job when the pub went bankrupt  his father drinking all the profits. He then had a variety of jobs  from coffee salesman to messenger.His first big-screen role was in Poor Cow (1967)  although his two-minute scene was ultimately cut from the completed film. Soon after  he caught the attention of director Lindsay Anderson who cast him in the role of a rebellious student in his film Se.... (1968). The film catapulted Malcolm to stardom in Britain but failed everywhere else. He was so enthusiastic about the film's success that he wanted to do another right away. He began writing what would become the semi-autobiographical O Lucky Man! (1973). Then he starred as Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick's controversial Arancia meccanica (1971)  a role that gave him world fame  and legendary status (although typecasting him as a in villainous roles). In early 1976  he spent nearly a year working on what would later be one of the most infamous films of all time  the semi-pornographic Caligola (1979)  financed by Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione. Around that time  the British film industry collapsed  forcing him to flee to America to continue working. His first American film was L'uomo venuto dall'impossibile (1979). He then did Britannia Hospital (1982)  the last part of Lindsay Anderson's working-class trilogy that started with Se.... (1968).In the mid-1980s  the years of alcohol and drug abuse  including $1000 a week on cocaine  caught up with him. Years of abuse took its toll on him; his black hairs were now gray. Looking older than he really was  nobody wanted to cast him for playing younger roles. The big roles having dried up  he did many B-rated movies. The 1990s were kinder to him  though. In 1994  he was cast as Dr. Tolian Soran  the man who killed Captain James T. Kirk in Generazioni (1994). He was back on the track  playing villains again. He played another in the classic BBC miniseries Our Friends in the North (1996). Today  with more than 100 films under his belt  he is one of the greatest actors in America. He still does not have American citizenship  but he likes the no-nonsense American ways. He resides in the northern suburbs of Los Angeles  California.,1943-06-13,Horsforth  Yorkshire  England  UK,,,2,5

This led to a lot of TV work and a lead role opposite Harrison Ford in the highly acclaimed thriller Witness - Il testimone (1985).

One of them was Jerry Bruckheimer  who cast her as Charlie Blackwood in the mega-hit Top Gun (1986) which became the highest-grossing film of the year and gave her some major name recognition.Ironically  that breakthrough role didn't help her career in terms of high-profile work. She played prosecutor Kathryn Murphy in Sotto accusa (1988) with Jodie Foster who won an Academy Award for her role  but unfortunately for McGillis she was overlooked for any major nomination. Never interested in being box-office gold  she remained loyal to the theater  even after being established as a major star during the mid to late 1980s  taking such various stage roles in such William Shakespeare plays as "The Merchant of Venice"  "Don Juan"  "Twelfth Night"  "The Merry Wives of Windsor"  "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream".

nm0000535,Rose McGowan,Rose Arianna McGowan,163,Rose McGowan is an American actress and director  known for her contribution to independent film. Since the age of nineteen  she has appeared in acclaimed films by Gregg Araki  Wes Craven  Brian De Palma  Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. In 2014  her directorial debut Dawn (2014) was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Rose Arianna McGowan was born on September 5  1973 in Florence  Tuscany  Italy  to American parents Terri and Daniel Patrick McGowan. She is the second eldest of six siblings  and has Irish  French  and English ancestry. As a young child  she was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God. During the early 1980s  her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene  Oregon  USA. Following the divorce of her parents  Rose relocated to Gig Harbor  Washington  to live with her grandmother. At age 14  McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release  she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. McGowan's career as an actor began with Doom Generation (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd  the character of Amy Blue was  coincidentally  awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance  she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream (1996)  she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Vivere fino in fondo (1997)  Lewis & Clark & George (1997)  Southie (1998) and Amiche cattive (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001  she remarked: "There is great love  but our lifestyle difference is  unfortunately  even greater". Rose continued to work solidly  appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's Il massacro di Attica (2001)  a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in "Stealing Bess" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Streghe (1998)  a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years. When "Charmed" finished its run in 2006  McGowan emerged in top form. Critics praised her efforts in Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007)  and Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse - A prova di morte (2007). In several interviews  McGowan has expressed a general apathy and disdain for Hollywood. Despite this  her work ethic remains strong. Following her recent marriage to LA-based artist Davey Detail  the actress has resolved to purse further projects as a director.,1973-09-05,Florence  Tuscany  Italy,,,1,0

nm0000552,Eddie Murphy,Edward Regan Murphy,176,Edward Regan Murphy was born April 3  1961 in Brooklyn  New York  to Lillian Lynch (born: Lillian Laney)  a telephone operator  and Charles Edward Murphy  a transit police officer who was also an amateur comedian and actor. After his father died  his mother married Vernon Lynch  a foreman at a Breyer's Ice Cream plant. His brothers are Charlie Murphy & Vernon Lynch Jr. Eddie had aspirations of being in show business since he was a child. A bright kid growing up in the streets of New York  Murphy spent a great deal of time on impressions and comedy stand-up routines rather than academics. His sense of humor and wit made him a stand out amongst his classmates at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. By the time he was fifteen  Murphy worked as a stand-up comic on the lower part of New York  wooing audiences with his dead-on impressions of celebrities and outlooks on life.In the early 1980s  at the age of 19  Murphy was offered a contract for the Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time Players of Il Saturday Night Live (1975)  where Murphy exercised his comedic abilities in impersonating African American figures and originating some of the show's most memorable characters: Velvet Jones  Mr. Robinson  and a disgruntled and angry Gumby. Murphy made his feature film debut in 48 ore (1982)  alongside Nick Nolte. The two's comedic and antagonistic chemistry  alongside Murphy's believable performance as a streetwise convict aiding a bitter  aging cop  won over critics and audiences. The next year  Murphy went two for two  with another hit  pairing him with John Landis  who later became a frequent collaborator with Murphy in Il principe cerca moglie (1988) and Beverly Hills Cop III - Un piedipiatti a Beverly Hills III (1994). Beverly Hills Cop - Un piedipiatti a Beverly Hills (1984) was the film that made Murphy a box-office superstar and most notably made him a celebrity worldwide  and it remains one of the all-time biggest domestic blockbusters in motion-picture history. Murphy's performance as a young Detroit cop in pursuit of his friend's murderers earned him a third consecutive Golden Globe nomination. Axel Foley became one of Murphy's signature characters. On top of his game  Murphy was unfazed by his success  that is until his box office appeal and choices in scripts resulted into a spotty mix of hits and misses into the late 1980s and early 1990s.Films like Il bambino d'oro (1986) and Beverly Hills Cop II - Un piedipiatti a Beverly Hills II (1987) were critically panned but were still massive draws at the box office. In 1989  Murphy  coming off another hit  Il principe cerca moglie (1988)  found failure with his directorial debut  Harlem Nights (1989). Ancora 48 ore (1990) and his turn as a hopeless romantic in Il principe delle donne (1992) did little to resuscitate his career. However  his remake of Jerry Lewis's Il professore matto (1996) brought Murphy's drawing power back into fruition. From there  Murphy rebounded with occasional hits and misses but has long proven himself as a skilled comedic actor with laudable range pertaining to characterizations and mannerisms. Though he has grown up a lot since his fast-lane rise as a superstar in the 1980s  Murphy has lived the Hollywood lifestyle with controversy  criticism  scandal  and the admiration of millions worldwide for his talents. As Murphy had matured throughout the years  learning many lessons about the Hollywood game in the process  he settled down with more family-oriented humor with Il dottor Dolittle (1998)  Mulan (1998)  Bowfinger (1999)  and the animated smash Shrek (2001)  in a supporting role that showcased Murphy's comedic personality and charm. Throughout the 2000s  he further starred in the hits La casa dei fantasmi (2003)  Shrek 2 (2004)  Dreamgirls (2006) (for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar)  Norbit (2007)  Shrek Terzo (2007)  and Shrek e vissero felici e contenti (2010).Murphy was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy from 1993 to 2006. Murphy has eight children.,1961-04-03,Brooklyn  New York City  New York  USA,,,1,5

Judd attended St. Paul's preparatory school in Concord  New Hampshire before majoring in philosophy at the prestigious Haverford College in Haverford  Pennsylvania. The acting bug bit when he went to watch a friend's audition and was obliged to audition in order to stay. He won the role.After graduation  Judd headed for New York City and the Stella Adler Conservatory where he was believable in the role as the street-smart Eddie Keaton in the comedy American Yuppies (1984). Judd's next film role was as the stodgy ROTC cadet  Phil Hicks  in the ensemble comedy Fandango (1985). Important and diverse roles in the brat-pack films Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985) quickly followed. With his privileged upbringing  Judd could have brought the right degree of preppy-smarmyness  (ala James Spader)  to any number of vapid roles  but his intense stare and dark smoldering looks gave him a hint of danger which added to his credibility in films like Giovani omicidi (1987)  Colpo di scena (1987) and New Jack City (1991).While Judd's career has been peppered with under-promoted films and poorly-written television appearances  critics have not been overly kind to this misunderstood actor.,1959-11-28,Portland  Maine  USA,,,0,0

nm0000583,Wolfgang Petersen,Wolfgang Petersen,178,This director seems to shine most when making movies that can best be described as part action movies/part disaster movies.Beginning with Outbreak (1995) about the outbreak of a killer virus. This film had shades of an Irwin Allen disaster movie  The Swarm (1978)  about the outbreak of killer bees. Both films had the military and scientists clash  also both had choppers all over the place.Then came Air Force One (1997)  about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film.The Perfect Storm (2000) came next  and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay  the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film.And then came Poseidon (2006)  about a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake  but with Poseidon it was now official..this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure (1972). The new Poseidon movie was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way. From casting to scripting the movie was terrible and our director made the same mistake seen in The Perfect Storm by having fake CGI sea water all over the place.,1941-03-14,Emden  Germany,,,1,1

Her big break came in 1991 when she was cast in the part of a college frosh on the television sitcom Tutti al college (1987). She made her feature film debut two years later in Nella giungla di cemento (1993).

nm0000588,Martha Plimpton,Martha Campbell Plimpton,165,She has show biz in her blood. Martha Plimpton was born November 16  1970  in New York City to two actors: Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton. Martha began her career at age 8  when her mom had a friend of hers  composer Elizabeth Swados  enroll her in an actors' workshop. At age 10  she got a small part in Il volto dei potenti (1981)  and also made a series of Calvin Klein commercials.Her first substantial film role was as a tomboy in Topo di fiume (1984); the following year  Steven Spielberg cast her in I Goonies (1985). Martha met River Phoenix while they were both filming Mosquito Coast (1986)  but since she was only 15 at the time  she did not go out with him. Even though she had a small part in the movie  it established her as a serious actress. Martha appeared in movies such as the screwball comedy Un gentleman a New York (1988) and  that same year  she was paired again with Phoenix in Vivere in fuga (1988). They dated for a while and then broke up. For a while  she was engaged to actor Jon Patrick Walker.As if making movies didn't keep her busy enough  Martha frequently worked at theaters and made her Chicago debut with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company Ensemble in "The Libertine" in 1996. As a member of that ensemble  she received a National Medal of Arts award in the autumn of 1998. As for movies  Colin Fitz (1997) and Eye of God (1997) in which she plays the starring role  have been run at the Sundance Film Festival. Although some recent movies have had low box office (Pecker (1998) $2.1 million  and 200 Cigarettes (1999) $6.8 million)  Martha's performances shine and she often rises above her material.Perhaps recalling how important acting lessons were to her as a child  she donates her time and efforts to the "52nd Street Project" which is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to matching the inner-city children with professional theater artists to create original theater  by writing  directing and performing their own plays. Perhaps one of the inner-city kids she is coaching will be the next famous actress in Hollywood.,1970-11-16,New York City  New York  USA,,,0,0

nm0000602,Robert Redford,Charles Robert Redford Jr.,179,Charles Robert Redford  Jr. was born on August 18  1936  in Santa Monica  California  to Martha (Hart)  from Texas  and Charles Robert Redford  an accountant for Standard Oil  who was originally from Connecticut. He is of English  Scottish  Cornish  and Irish ancestry. Robert's mother died in 1955  the year after he graduated from high school. Robert was a scrappy kid who stole hubcaps in school and lost his college baseball scholarship at the University of Colorado because of drunkenness.After leaving UoC  he spent some time drifting across America  spending a time working in the California oil fields. Having saved enough he moved to Europe studying art in Paris and Florence.Back in the States he decided on a career as a theatrical designer in New York. Enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Art he turned to acting making his stage debut in 'Tall Story'. In 1962 he was signed for the stage production of 'Barefoot in the Park' which was a smash hit but it wasn't until 5 years later when it was filmed that he became an important star.Television and stage experience coupled with all-American good looks led to movies and television roles. His breakthrough role was "The Sundance Kid" in Butch Cassidy (1969)  when the actor was 33. Come eravamo (1973) and La stangata (1973)  both in 1973  made Redford the number one box office star for the next three years. Redford used his clout to advance environmental causes and his riches to acquire Utah property  which he transformed into a ranch and the Sundance ski resort. In 1980  he established the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Its annual film festival has become one of the world's most influential. Redford's directorial debut  Gente comune (1980)  won him the Academy Award as Best Director in 1981. He waited eight years before getting behind the camera again  this time for the screen version of John Nichols' acclaimed novel of the Southwest  Milagro (1988).

nm0000607,Paul Reubens,Paul Rubenfeld,180,Paul Reubens was born Paul Rubenfeld on August 27  1952 in Peekskill  New York  to Judy (Rosen)  a teacher  and Milton Rubenfeld  a car salesman who had flown for the air forces of the U.S.  U.K.  and Israel  becoming one of the latter country's pioneering pilots. Paul grew up in Sarasota  Florida  where his parents owned a lamp store. During winters  The Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus called Sarasota home  and young Paul counted such big-top families as the Wallendas and the Zacchinis among his neighbors. When he was 11-years-old  he joined the local Asolo Theater  and during the next six years  he appeared in a variety of plays. After graduating from Sarasota High School in 1970  he attended Boston University for one year before deciding to seek his fortune as Paul Reubens in Hollywood  where he enrolled as an acting major at the California Institute of the Arts and accepted a string of pay-the-rent jobs ranging from pizza chef to Fuller Brush salesman.In the mid 1970s  his acting career grew slowly and steadily with small roles in theater productions  gigs at local comedy clubs and four guest appearances on The Gong Show (1976). During this time of education/employment  he joined an improvisational comedy troupe called The Groundlings. The popular gang of yuksters  whose roster has included Conan O'Brien  Lisa Kudrow  the late Phil Hartman  Jon Lovitz  and Julia Sweeney  wrung laughs from audiences with skits starring scads of imaginative  self-created characters. Among Reubens's contributions to this comedic community were a philandering husband named Moses Feldman  an Indian chief named Jay Longtoe  and the now fallen Pee-Wee Herman  who debuted in 1978.Pee-Wee was a funny man-child of indeterminate age and sexuality who created a sarcastic enthusiasm for the popular culture of the '50s and '60s. The geeky character's wardrobe consisted of a gray suit  a white short-sleeved shirt accessorized with a red clip-on bow tie  and white patent-leather loafers. He wore his jet-black hair military short with a defiant tuft in front  and he accentuated his lily-white complexion with pink cheeks and red lipstick. Reubens drew inspiration for Pee-Wee's geeky behavior from a youth he had attended summer camp with  and derived his creation's boyish voice from a character he played as a child actor. Pee-Wee appeared for only 10 minutes of The Groundlings show  but he nonetheless built up a considerable following and turned out to be a star of the '80s and early '90s. The Pee-Wee Herman Show (1981)  ran for five sellout months at the Los Angeles's Roxy nightclub  and HBO taped the performance and aired it as a special.Now a genuine comedy-circuit star  he became a frequent guest of David Letterman and a favorite at Caroline's in New York. In 1984  he sold out Carnegie Hall. He later auditioned for the cast of Il Saturday Night Live (1975)  but when that didn't turn out as planned  he started writing a feature-length screenplay for Pee-Wee to star in  and asked friend Tim Burton to direct. Released to wildly divergent reviews  Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)  followed its star cross-country in a madcap search for his beloved  stolen bike. The $7 million picture ended up grossing $45 million. That following year  CBS which had been losing children's audiences to cable programming  was interested in finding something to shore up its Saturday Morning lineup. The network company signed him to act/produce and to direct its live-action children's program called Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986). They doled out an eye-popping budget of $325 000 per episode - the same price as a prime- time sitcom. Reubens received complete creative control  albeit with three minor exceptions. During its five-year-run on CBS  he never appeared in general as himself. He even granted printed interviews in full Pee-Wee regalia.The image of Pee-Wee was broken on July 26  1991. On his summer vacation  Reubens was visiting his parents in Sarasota and sought escape from boredom by catching a showing of the X-rated film  Nurse Nancy. He fell victim to a police sting operation and was arrested for sex charges when detectives allegedly saw him playing with his private parts. He was released on $219 bail and nobody realized what had happened until somebody recognized him beneath his long hair and goatee. The media went berserk: 'Kids show star arrested for indecent exposure'. Because of his behavior  CBS dropped the Playhouse and related merchandise was released from its shelves. He agreed to pay a $50 fine plus $85 in court costs to Sarasota County  and he produced a 30 second public service message for the Partnership For Drug-Free America commercial. As part of the deal  the county sealed all legal papers relating to the actor's arrest and didn't leave Reubens with a criminal record. The scandal marked the virtual death of Pee-Wee Herman. Reubens appeared as his favorite character for the last time at that Autumn's MTV Music Video Awards. The enthusiastic reception was not surprising  as he had received 15 thousand supportive letters during his arrest. Regardless  he had recently made a promise not to play Pee-Wee anymore and used his arrest as an chance to portray other roles. A new feature length film by Netflix available beginning March 18  2016 will allow Reubens to show Pee-Wee fans his character again in Pee-wee's Big Holiday (2016).Reubens has landed a series of offbeat character roles. One year after he was taken into custody  he appeared in Burton's Batman - Il ritorno (1992) as the Penguin's unloving father  and as a vampire henchman in Buffy - L'ammazzavampiri (1992). Subsequent jobs have included a voice over for Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  a healthy stint as Andrew J. Lansing III on Murphy Brown (1988)  and roles in the feature films  Dunston - Licenza di ridere (1996)  Matilda 6 mitica (1996)  Buddy - Un gorilla per amico (1997) and Mystery Men (1999).

nm0000619,Tim Roth,Timothy Simon Smith,173,Often mistaken for an American because of his skill at imitating accents  actor Tim Roth was born Timothy Simon Roth on May 14  1961 in Lambeth  London  England. His mother  Ann  was a teacher and landscape painter. His father  Ernie  was a journalist who had changed the family name from "Smith" to "Roth"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn  New York  to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.Tim grew up in Dulwich  a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton  where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.The blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1982). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983)  which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir Vendetta (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent & Theo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosencrantz e Guildenstern sono morti (1990).He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Le iene (1992)  but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead  and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth  as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's collaborations with Tarantino  a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Four Rooms (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995).Continuing to take on disparate roles  Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Tutti dicono I Love You (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur's last film  the twisted comedy Gridlock'd - Istinti criminali (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV  Roth's work as the innocent  seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with Zona di guerra (1999)  a frank  critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade  an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001). Roth was  of course  all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work  including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola's esoteric Un'altra giovinezza (2007) to becoming "The Abomination" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster L'incredibile Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009),1961-05-14,London  England  UK,,,0,2

His father was of Irish and German descent  and his mother was of French-Canadian  English  and German ancestry. When he was six years old  his parents divorced. A year later  his mother married Eugene Addis  a Miami Beach police officer  and moved to Miami Shores  Florida. After graduating from Horace Mann Junior High School  Rourke's family moved to a house located on 47th Street and Prairie Avenue in Miami Beach.

Jensen.In 1971 he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School  and after working for a short time as a bus boy at the famed Forge Restaurant on Miami Beach  Rourke moved back to New York to seek out a career in acting.Rourke's teenage years were more aimed toward sports more than acting. He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At the age of 12  Rourke won his first boxing match as an 118-pound bantamweight  defeating Javier Villanueva. Some of his early matches were fought as Andre Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach soon joining the Police Athletic League boxing program. In 1969 Rourke  now weighing 140 pounds  sparred with former World Welterweight champion Luis Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the number one-rated middleweight boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion Nino Benvenuti. Rourke claims to have received a concussion in this sparring match.In 1971  at the Florida Golden Gloves  Rourke received another concussion from a boxing match. Doctors told him to take a year off and rest. In 1972 Rourke knocked out Ron Robinson in 18 seconds and John Carver in 39 seconds. On Aug. 20  1973  Rourke knocked out 'Sherman "Big Train"' Bergman' in 31 seconds.

At one point  he reportedly scored 12 consecutive first-round knockouts. As an amateur  Rourke had been friendly with pro-boxer Tommy Torino. When Rourke decided to return to boxing as a professional in 1991  Torino promoted some of Rourke's fights. Rourke was trained by former pro-boxer Freddie Roach at Miami Beach's 5th Street Gym and the Outlaw Boxing Club Gym in Los Angeles. He made $250 for his pro debut  but by the end of his second year of boxing  he had earned a million dollars. In June 1994  Rourke appeared on the cover of World Boxing Magazine. He sparred with world champions James Toney  John David Jackson  and Tommy Morrison.Rourke wished to have 16 professional fights and then fight for a world title. However  he retired in 1994 after eight bouts and never got his desired title fight. His boxing career resulted in severe facial injuries that required a number of operations to repair his damaged face. Rourke went back to acting but worked in relative obscurity until he won a Golden Globe Award for his role as Randy "The Ram" Robinson in The Wrestler (2008). He was nominated for Best Actor  as well  but lost.,1952-09-16,Schenectady  New York  USA,,,2,0

nm0000626,John Sayles,John Thomas Sayles,193,A bright child  John Sayles began reading novels before age 9. A Williams grad in 1972  he shunned a corporate career to work various blue-collar jobs  moving to east Boston to take a factory job. He wrote stories and submitted them to various magazines  and the Atlantic Monthly gave him the idea of publishing them in a novel--thus "Pride of the Bimbos" (1975) was born.In the late 1970s he worked for renowned low-budget producer Roger Corman as a screenwriter. He saved much of the money he earned from that job  got some friends together and made Return of the Secaucus Seven (1979) in 25 days. Altough it was a hit  he had trouble obtaining financing for the films he wanted to make because he would not give up his right of final cut. Promesse  promesse (1983) was Sayles' only film made under studio control.In 1983 the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship granted him a tax-free income of $32 000 a year for 5 years. That stipend and money he earned for writing such films as Cro Magnon odissea nella preistoria (1986)  Enormous Changes at the Last Minute (1983) and Ladro e gentiluomo (1989) enabled him to make the kinds of films he wanted to make. Stella solitaria (1996) placed Sayles in the ranks of top American filmmakers. In it and his other films  a broadly appealing social consciousness emerges  showing Sayles to be concerned with what's going on with regional cultures  national values and what living in the US is like today.

nm0000631,Ridley Scott,Ridley Scott,174,Described by film producer Michael Deeley as "the very best eye in the business"  director Ridley Scott was born on November 30  1937 in South Shields  Tyne and Wear (then County Durham). His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the Royal Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London's Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department.In 1962  he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director's course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police series Z Cars (1962)  Z Cars: Error of Judgement (1965). More TV work followed until  frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC  he went into advertising. With his younger brother  Tony Scott  he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television  including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak's New World Symphony which are still talked about today ("'e were a great baker were our dad.")He began working with producer David Puttnam in the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor  I duellanti (1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d'Or  more than successfully launching Scott's feature film career. The success of Guerre stellari (1977) inspired Scott's interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O'Bannon's low budget science fiction horror movie Alien (1979)  a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.Blade Runner (1982) followed in 1982 to  at best  a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed  its reputation grew - and Scott's with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott's next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his "1984"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22  1984. Scott's movie career has seen a few flops (notably Legend (1985) and 1492 - La conquista del paradiso (1992))  but with successes like Thelma & Louise (1991)  Il gladiatore (2000) and Black Hawk Down - Black Hawk abbattuto (2001) to offset them  his reputation remains solidly intact.Ridley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen's New Year Honours for his "substantial contribution to the British film industry". On July 3  2015  he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018. BAFTA described him as "a visionary director  one of the great British film-makers whose work has made an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Forty years since his directorial debut  his films continue to cross the boundaries of style and genre  engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of film talent.",1937-11-30,South Shields  County Durham  England  UK,,,2,3

He moved with his family  including sister Carolyn  to suburban Massepequa  Long Island  at a young age. Jerry's dad  who had a terrific sense of humor  was a commercial sign maker.Jerry attended Oswego College in upstate New York but transferred to Queens College back in New York City. Developed interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. Went straight from college graduation to amateur night tryout at New York's Catch a Rising Star  1976.Continued to perform in local clubs and Catskill Mountain resorts until his career was boosted by an appearance on a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special  1976. Career took off after first successful spot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)  May 1981  at age 27. Appearances on [error] and The Merv Griffin Show (1962) followed. Also appeared four times as Frankie on Benson (1979) sitcom. After he was abruptly fired from the show  he swore never to do another sitcom unless he had greater control.

nm0000635,Yahoo Serious,Gregory Booth Pead,178,Yahoo Serious (born Greg Pead) became one of Australia's most successful independent conceptual artists and filmmakers of the 1980s and 1990s. Considered the first Australian to write  produce  direct and star in a major motion picture. He legally changed his name to "Yahoo Serious" in 1980 before his sudden fame. He grew up near Newcastle  Australia and worked as a tyre fitter for a time to get through art school  but was eventually expelled from the school. Soon after he started combining his artistic talents with absurdist comedy and earned a lot of skeptical looks along the way. At age 21  Yahoo wrote  produced  directed and filmed Coaltown  a documentary tracing the socio-political history of coal mining. The following year he won the National Award for Best Australian Educational Documentary for his TV series "Lifestyle." After extensive traveling throughout Asia  Europe and America  he began writing  directing and performing in experimental comedy. This led to spectacular success with his first weird  skimpily-budgeted vehicle Young Einstein (1988)  the story of a young Tasmanian farmer who discovers rock music along with the theory of relativity. Blending political/social satire  silliness and slapstick with eye-popping visuals  he hit the jackpot with young audiences. Grossing over $100 million  he instantly branched out internationally  hitting all the popular talk shows and even making the cover of TIME magazine (February  1989). Audiences took a fascination to his unique cinematic style. True to form  Serious involved himself in practically every detail of the making of the movie  from creating the original concept and script through incorporating the visual design and music soundtrack and performing all his own stunts. However  following this crazy roller coaster ride  he was not able to produce a follow up movie soon enough and quickly became yesterday's news. Coming out five years later  Reckless Kelly (1993)  the story of a Robin Hood-like  motorcycle-riding robber who becomes a Hollywood movie star  matched his first film in unconventional silliness but not popularity and disappeared quickly. His third movie  Mr. Accident (1999)  about the most accident-prone man in the world  also was a commercial disaster while still finding a cult following.

nm0000647,Alan Smithee,Alan Smithee,,'Alan Smithee' is a common pseudonym for directors whose film was clearly taken away from her/him and recut heavily against her/his wishes in ways that completely altered the film.The Directors Guild contract generally does not permit a director to remove her/his name from films. The Directors Guild has been striving for decades to establish the director as the "author" of a film  and part of getting the credit for the successes is taking the blame for the failures. The only exceptions they make are cases in which a film was clearly taken away from a director and recut heavily against her/his wishes in ways that completely altered the film. Directors are required to appeal to the Guild in such cases. If the appeal is successful  their name is replaced by Alan Smithee. So if you notice a film directed by Alan Smithee  it is certain it is not what its director intended  and likely that it is not any good.,,,,,0,0

nm0000661,Donald Sutherland,Donald McNichol Sutherland,192,The towering presence of Canadian actor Donald Sutherland is often noticed  as are his legendary contributions to cinema. He has appeared in almost 200 different shows and films. He is also the father of renowned actor Kiefer Sutherland  among others.Donald McNichol Sutherland was born in Saint John  New Brunswick  to Dorothy Isobel (McNichol) and Frederick McLea Sutherland  who worked in sales and electricity. He has Scottish  as well as German and English  ancestry. Sutherland worked several different jobs - he was a radio DJ in his youth - and was almost set on becoming an engineer after graduating from the University of Toronto with a degree in engineering. However  he also graduated with a degree in drama  and he chose to abandon becoming an engineer in favour of an actor.Sutherland's first roles were bit parts and consisted of such films as the horror film Le cinque chiavi del terrore (1965) which starred Christopher Lee. He was also appearing in episodes of TV shows such as "The Saint" and "Court Martial". Sutherland's break would come soon  though  and it would come in the form of a war film in which he was barely cast.The reason he was barely cast was because he had been a last-minute replacement for an actor that had dropped out of the film. The role he played was that of the dopey but loyal Vernon Pinkley in the war film Quella sporca dozzina (1967). The film also starred Lee Marvin  Charles Bronson  and Telly Savalas. The picture was an instant success as an action/war film  and Sutherland played upon this success by taking another role in a war film: this was  however  a comedy called M.A.S.H. (1970) which landed Sutherland the starring role alongside Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt. This is now considered a classic among film goers  and the 35-year old actor was only getting warmed up.Sutherland took a number of other roles in between these two films  such as the theatrical adaptation Edipo re (1968)  the musical Joanna (1968) and the Clint Eastwood-helmed war comedy I guerrieri (1970). It was I guerrieri (1970) that became more well-known  and it reunited Sutherland with Telly Savalas. 1970 and 1971 offered Sutherland a number of other films  the best of them would have to be Una squillo per l'ispettore Klute (1971). The film  which made Jane Fonda a star  is about a prostitute whose friend is mysteriously murdered. Sutherland received no critical acclaim like his co-star Fonda (she won an Oscar) but his career did not fade.Moving on from Una squillo per l'ispettore Klute (1971)  Sutherland landed roles such as the lead in the thriller I diamanti dell'ispettore Klute (1973)  and another lead in the western Alien Thunder (1974). These films did not match up to "Klute"'s success  though Sutherland took a supporting role that would become one of his most infamous and most critically acclaimed. He played the role of the murderous fascist leader in the Bernardo Bertolucci Italian epic Novecento (1976). Sutherland also gained another memorable role as a marijuana-smoking university professor in Animal House (1978) among other work that he did in this time.Another classic role came in the form of the Robert Redford film  Gente comune (1980). Sutherland portrays an older father figure who must deal with his children in an emotional drama of a film. It won Best Picture  and while both the supporting stars were nominated for Oscars  Sutherland once again did not receive any Academy Award nomination. He moved on to play a Nazi spy in a film based on Ken Follett's book "Eye of the Needle" and he would star alongside Al Pacino in the commercial and critical disaster that was Revolution (1985). While it drove Al Pacino out of films for four years  Sutherland continued to find work. This work led to the dramatic  well-told story of apartheid Un'arida stagione bianca (1989) alongside the legendary actor Marlon Brando.Sutherland's next big success came in the Oliver Stone film JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991) where Sutherland plays the chilling role of Mister X  an anonymous source who gives crucial information about the politics surrounding President Kennedy. Once again  he was passed over at the Oscars  though Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw. Sutherland went on to appear in Buffy - L'ammazzavampiri (1992)  L'ombra del lupo (1992)  and Rivelazioni (1994).The new millennium provided an interesting turn in Sutherland's career: reuniting with such former collaborators as Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones  Sutherland starred in Space Cowboys (2000). He also appeared as the father figure to Nicole Kidman's character in Ritorno a Cold Mountain (2003) and Charlize Theron's character in The Italian Job (2003). He has also made a fascinating  Oscar-worthy performance as the revolutionist Mr. Thorne in Land of the Blind (2006) and also as a judge in Reign Over Me (2007). Recently  he has joined forces with his son Rossif Sutherland and Canadian comic Russell Peters with the new comedy L'artista della truffa (2010)  as well as acting alongside Jamie Bell and Channing Tatum in the sword-and-sandal film The Eagle (2011). Sutherland has also taken a role in the remake of Charles Bronson's film Professione: assassino (1972).Donald Sutherland has made a lasting legacy on Hollywood  whether portraying a chilling and horrifying villain  or playing the older respectable character in his films. A true character actor  Sutherland is one of Canada's most well-known names and will hopefully continue on being so long after his time.,1935-07-17,Saint John  New Brunswick  Canada,,,2,5

nm0000668,Emma Thompson,Emma Thompson,173,Emma Thompson was born on April 15  1959 in Paddington  London  into a family of actors - father Eric Thompson and mother Phyllida Law  who has co-starred with Thompson in several films. Her sister  Sophie Thompson  is an actor as well. Her father was English-born and her mother is Scottish-born. Thompson's wit was cultivated by a cheerful  clever  creative family atmosphere  and she was a popular and successful student. She attended Cambridge University  studying English Literature  and was part of the university's Footlights Group  the famous group where  previously  many of the Monty Python members had first met.Thompson graduated in 1980 and embarked on her career in entertainment  beginning with stints on BBC radio and touring with comedy shows. She soon got her first major break in television  on the comedy skit program Alfresco (1983)  writing and performing along with her fellow Footlights Group alums Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. She also worked on other TV comedy review programs in the mid-1980s  occasionally with some of her fellow Footlights alums  and often with actor Robbie Coltrane.Thompson found herself collaborating again with Fry in 1985  this time in his stage adaptation of the play "Me and My Girl" in London's West End  in which she had a leading role  playing Sally Smith. The show was a success and she received favorable reviews  and the strength of her performance led to her casting as the lead in the BBC television miniseries Fortunes of War (1987)  in which Thompson and her co-star  Kenneth Branagh  play an English ex-patriate couple living in Eastern Europe as the Second World War erupts. Thompson won a BAFTA Award for her work on the program. She married Branagh in 1989  continued to work with him professionally  and formed a production company with him. In the late 80s and early 90s  she starred in a string of well-received and successful television and film productions  most notably her lead role in the Merchant-Ivory production of Casa Howard (1992)  which confirmed her ability to carry a movie on both sides of the Atlantic and appropriately showered her with trans-Atlantic honors - both an Oscar and a BAFTA award.Since then  Thompson has continued to move effortlessly between the art film world and mainstream Hollywood  though even her Hollywood roles tend to be in more up-market productions. She continues to work on television as well  but is generally very selective about which roles she takes. She writes for the screen as well  such as the screenplay for Ang Lee's Ragione e sentimento (1995)  in which she also starred as Elinor Dashwood  and the teleplay adaptation of Margaret Edson's acclaimed play Wit (2001)  in which she also starred.Thompson is known for her sophisticated  skillful  though her critics say somewhat mannered  performances  and of course for her arch wit  which she is unafraid to point at herself - she is a fearless self-satirist. Thompson and Branagh divorced in 1994  and Thompson is now married to fellow actor Greg Wise  who had played Willoughby in Ang Lee's Ragione e sentimento (1995). Thompson and Wise have one child  Gaia  born in 1999.,1959-04-15,Paddington  London  England  UK,,,1,2

nm0000672,Meg Tilly,Margaret Elizabeth Chan,168,Meg Tilly was set on being a dancer  and at 17 connected to the Connecticut Ballet Company and later Throne Dance Theatre. It was in this capacity that she had her screen debut in Alan Parker's Saranno famosi (1980). Unfortunately  an injury to her back cut short her plans for a dance career  and a small appearance in the TV series Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) turned her towards acting (her dancing skills were not all forgotten  as was evident in Il grande freddo (1983) and Psycho II (1983)). She received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Agnese di Dio (1985)  and nobody doubted that she was on her way to stardom. One step on the road to that status was her being cast in Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984) as Constanza  but again her body interfered  and seven weeks into the production with her foot in a cast were more than the producers could accept  and she was replaced. Her "consolation"  was a role in Forman's next project Valmont (1989)  didn't do her career much good. Since then she has averaged a movie a year  and with the exception of Fuga per un sogno (1992)  none have tapped the enormous reservoir of talent she has.,1960-02-14,Long Beach  California  USA,,,2,2

When his films  especially Soldato d'Orange (1977) and Il quarto uomo (1983)  received international recognition  Verhoeven moved to the US. His first US film was L'amore e il sangue (1985) in 1985  but it was RoboCop (1987) and  especially  Atto di forza (1990) that made him a big box office success.

After appearing in 20 national TV commercials  Sela moved to L.A. and got her first TV role in Navy (1983); she dated tall costar Richard Dean Anderson for 3 years (which is much longer than the TV series lasted).

But perhaps Sela is best known for starring in the TV series Sisters (1991)  which ran for 6 seasons.

nm0000701,Kate Winslet,Kate Elizabeth Winslet,169,Ask Kate Winslet what she likes about any of her characters  and the word "ballsy" is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result  she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading  Berkshire  into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors  maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre  and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven  dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time  which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years  she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17  when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Creature del cielo (1994). The film  based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder  received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.Still a relative unknown  Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Ragione e sentimento (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star  Emma Thompson  and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces  playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater  the passionate  rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet  swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy  unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination  making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997)  Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Ideus Kinky - Un treno per Marrakech (1998) and Holy Smoke - Fuoco sacro (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter  as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a "deprogramming" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills - La penna dello scandalo (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016  she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times  winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader - A voce alta (2008)  playing a former concentration camp guard.For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015)  she received her seventh Academy Award nomination.Off camera  Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters  Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses)  and a brother  Joss.In 1998  she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter  Mia Honey Threapleton  in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son  Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes  later that year. After seven years of marriage  in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated  and divorced in October 2010. In 2012  Kate married Ned Rocknroll  with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.,1975-10-05,Reading  Berkshire  England  UK,,,2,3

However  her collegiate plans were shortly dashed when she accepted roles to star in two major motion pictures: Paura (1996)  alongside Mark Wahlberg  and Freeway - No Exit (1996) with Kiefer Sutherland. Although neither film was a huge box-office success  they did help to establish Reese as a rising starlet in Hollywood and open the door for bigger and better film roles. Those bigger roles came in movies such as Pleasantville (1998)  Election (1999) and Cruel Intentions - Prima regola non innamorarsi (1999).Her breakthrough role came as Elle Woods in the 2001 comedy  La rivincita delle bionde (2001).

Soon after  he began to get bookings for small parts on television.Although his first credit was a small part in Ritorno al futuro - Parte II (1989)  Wood's first major film role was in the 'Barry Levinson' historical family drama Avalon (1990). Following that  Wood became an in-demand child actor  appearing in a number of major films such as La strada per il paradiso (1991)  Il grande volo (1992) and L'innocenza del diavolo (1993)  in which he co-starred with Macaulay Culkin. This was followed by the first role for which he received top-billing  Genitori cercasi (1994). Although the film was widely condemned and a disaster at the box office  Elijah was praised as the only good thing to come out of it.In 1996 Elijah starred in a movie remake of an old TV show  Flipper (1996). Many critics wondered if his ability as a child actor to capture an audience was wearing thin  as had many child actors'  but Wood deftly transitioned into a versatile performer with roles such as the endlessly curious Mikey Carver in Ang Lee' ensemble film Tempesta di ghiaccio (1997)  as well as parts in popcorn flicks like Deep Impact (1998) and The Faculty (1998). In 1999  Elijah was in three movies that never made it into wide release: Un amore  una vita  una svolta (1999) (released on satellite TV)  Black & White (1999) (released on home video) and Chain of Fools (2000).Wood's work in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of J.R.R.

After attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama  the 17-year-old Ackland made his professional stage debut in "The Hasty Heart" in 1945.Although he first appeared on film in John Boulting's and Roy Boulting's Oscar-winning thriller Minaccia atomica (1950) in an uncredited bit role  he made his credited debut in a supporting role in Vernon Sewell's Ghost Ship (1952). He would not again grace the big screen until the end of the decade. Instead  Ackland spent the latter half of the 1940s and the first half of the 1950s honing his craft in regional theatrical companies.In 1955 he left the English stage behind and moved to Africa to manage a tea plantation  an experience that likely informed his heralded performance 20 years later in Misfatto bianco (1987). In his two years in Africa he wrote plays and did service as a radio disc jockey. Upon his return to England in 1957  he joined the Old Vic company.From 1962-64 he served as associate director of the Mermaid Theatre. Subsequently  his stage acting career primarily was in London's commercial West End theater  where he made a name for himself in musicals.

In the straight theater he was a memorable Falstaff in William Shakespeare's "Henry IV Parts 1 & 2" and as Captain Shotover in George Bernard Shaw's "Heartbreak House". In the 1960s Ackland began appearing more regularly in films  and his career as a movie character actor picked up rapidly in the 1970s and began to flourish in the 1980s. It has shown little sign of abating in the 21st century  even though he's well into his 70s.In addition to his performance in "White Mischief"  among his more notable turns as an actor before the camera came in the BBC-TV production of Shadowlands (1986)  in which he played 'C.S. Lewis'  and in Arma letale 2 (1989) as the ruthless South African heavy  Arjen Rudd.He is the father of seven children  whom he listed as his "hobby" in a 1981 interview.

nm0000723,Deborah Adair,Deborah Adair Miller,,Deborah Adair was born in Lynchburg  Virginia on May 23  1952 to a father who was a Navy officer and a mother who was a Spanish teacher. She grew up with her brother Ashley and sister Ann. Her major influences were her mother and grandmother who always taught her to have confidence and self-assurance by telling her that she can have any job she wanted. She earned a degree in advertising and marketing at University of Washington  working afterward as a copywriter  commercial producer and assistant promotion manager for radio stations in Seattle  Washington. Her four-year marriage to Gary Baker  a budding politician  ended in 1978  prompting her to move to Hollywood. She waited tables and worked as a stewardess for a short time. But a flair for dramatic reading in high school led to voice-over work on commercials  then local stage productions. She found an agent who helped her land small parts in several TV series. But her big break came in 1980 when she was cast as Jill Foster Abbott on Febbre d'amore (1973). She was the third actress to play that role  but she made the character her own by playing her as a beautiful  sparkly bad girl. In 1983  she left daytime soap opera during stalled contract negotiations to accept the role of Tracy Kendall on highly rated night time soap opera Dynasty (1981)  where she played yet another bad girl.Aaron Spelling  the producer on "Dynasty"  was so impressed with her performance that he took her off "Dynasty" a year later and gave her the lead role of Daisy Lloyd on another prime time show Detective per amore (1984)  where she finally played a good girl. But that show was canceled a year later and Adair guest-starred on other shows  including Spelling's show Love Boat (1977) and Hotel (1983). In 1986  the "Young and the Restless" producers beckoned her back for one week to reprise her role as Jill when Brenda Dickson was out for a short time due to tension on the set. Adair maintained she had fun for that one week playing Jill  but Dickson remembered it differently when she unexpectedly came back to find Adair in the dressing room being uncomfortable. A few months later  Dickson left the role and Jess Walton was hired as a permanent replacement for Dickson. Of the four actresses who have played Jill since 1973  Adair is forever remembered as the "pretty Jill." But she was frustrated that her career had stalled just when her personal life gained momentum. She married producer Chip Hayes in 1987  and although it was a very happy marriage  she couldn't have children and it made her unhappy at the time. In 1990  Adair was performing in previews of Cynthia Heimel's play "A Girl's Guide to Chaos " when she had a freaky accident and herniated a disk. The accident caused her excruciating pain and she spent a year  on and off  in bed. She did some soul searching during that time and felt that everything happens in its own time.After she recovered  she picked up the pieces of her career and moved on to do a TV movie for Aaron Spelling titled Come sposare un milionario (1990) (1990)  where she played opposite another Spelling favorite: Heather Locklear. And her career picked up even more steam when Spelling reunited her with Locklear in the recurring role as Lucy Cabot on his prime time show Melrose Place (1992). She enjoyed being on the show because she spent a lot of time with her husband Hayes  who was one of the producers. While on "Melrose Place " she originated the role of Kate Roberts on Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) and became one of the few actors in history who had both a daytime soap opera and a nighttime soap opera at the same time. She left "Melrose Place" after one year to concentrate on the multi-dimensional role of Kate on "Days of our Lives " and her gamble paid off as she won the Best Supporting Actress Award at the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1994. But Adair and her husband wanted children. In 1995  she left her "Days of Our Lives" role to be a full-time mom after she and her husband adopted a child. Although  Lauren Koslow took over the role and played it for more than 15 years  Adair's fans cannot seem to forget her and hopes she will return to acting. But she enjoys the role of being real life mom so much that she and her husband adopted another child in 1997. For now  Adair seems content with her home life in Virginia and has not expressed any desire to return to acting  much to the chagrin of her fans.,1952-05-23,Lynchburg  Virginia  USA,,,1,2

A highly anticipated Broadway production is slated for this coming fall of 2018.Kevin has enjoyed an enduring  distinguished career which spans the breadth of almost four decades.

The scenes between the desperate and dependent brothers Treat and Phillip became staples in every acting class across the country. This production took him all over the world from New York City's Broadway (Theatre World Award) to London's West End with Albert Finney to the Hollywood movie starring Finney and Mathew Modine and directed by the late great Alan J.

As a boy  he roamed the cornfields  rivers  and forests of his home town and it is there that the values of modesty  honesty  and hard work were formed. These Midwestern values have served him well as he climbed the ladder of success  never forgetting the people and friends who helped and supported him along the way. Kevin's goals and ideals remain as steadfast today as they were as when he first started acting. Pursuing the art of acting has never been about fame and fortune for Kevin. His only desire in this world has been to be the best actor that he can possibly be. To achieve this  he realized early on that to be the best  he had to strive to work with the best material  on the most interesting  challenging  and new roles he could possibly find  and to seek to work with the most talented and inspiring directors and actors that walked the face of the planet. These same goals remain constant and true today and he is truly honored to have worked with such amazing and creative powerhouses throughout his career  most notably the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago who gave him his start.In the fall of 2010  Kevin walked in to a bank in Chicago to withdraw money from the very first bank account that he had opened when he had first started out  from his salad days and humble beginnings. The money was gone. He later painfully discovered that the money and account had been garnished by the IRS due to six to eight years of unfiled taxes that his "business manager" had agreed to be responsible for and shockingly  had acquired a $100 000 tax bill. Thus began a decade long twisting and turning nightmare in which he slowly discovered and came to believe  piece by piece  like putting together a scattered jigsaw puzzle  that his former business manager Arthur B. Greene had defrauded him of millions of dollars and also believed that the accounting firm Marks Paneth that Greene had merged with in early 2009 had helped hide the fraud. In December of 2014  having already sought help unsuccessfully from countless lawyers and unable to afford legal advocacy as he came to realize and believe that almost all of his savings had been absconded  Kevin filed a lawsuit pro se in the Federal Court in the Southern District of New York against Arthur B. Greene and Marks Paneth alleging fraud  racketeering  malpractice  and breach of fiduciary duty among other claims. Unfortunately  the judge dismissed many of these claims primarily due to statute of limitations issues. This does not mean that these crimes did not actually happen  it simply means that Kevin was too late in prosecuting the wrongdoers and bringing forth his claims in a timely fashion as the cancerous relationship with Greene had endured for almost 30 years. There is very much room for dispute on this however. Based on the legal concept the Doctrine of Estoppel  if a defendant does anything to mislead or prevent a plaintiff from learning of any malfeasance  wrongdoing  or fraud then the statute of limitations can be extended or tolled. Kevin adamantly believes that he was intentionally lied to  tricked  stalled  and misled which prevented him from learning of the alleged fraud earlier and consequently prohibited him from filing a timely claim. He wants to argue these fine points later in an appeal and hopefully reinstate the other dismissed claims which are the meat and substance of the lawsuit and claims that he filed originally in December of 2014. Remarkably  litigating the other permitted claims pro se  and all by himself  and with only a high school education  he was able to defeat a motion to dismiss on some of his other claims against two very large New York City law firms (Cohen Tauber Spievack & Wagner  and Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker) and is currently still litigating these claims in the Southern District of New York. He hopes to appeal all other dismissed claims including fraud and racketeering allegations in the future.Although this nightmare has been extremely stressful and disturbing and has literally turned his entire world upside down  it has also given him the opportunity to reexamine his life and why he got into acting in the first place  to press the reset button  and to pursue his career and dreams again with a clean slate and an open heart. It has taken a herculean effort on Kevin's part to rebuild trust after such a wounding and abusive experience  but it has also transformed him and has only made him stronger and more conscious in his pursuit of excellence and a deeply felt desire and commitment to use his talents for a greater good and to help and be of service to others. He feels it is important to let the entertainment industry know exactly why he has been off the radar for some time and that he is now back and ready to tackle this next stage of his career.

All eyes were peeled on this worthy pin-up who helped to bring back the glossy platinum-blonde allure of Marilyn Monroe  Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren. A stylish  highly appealing actress whose hourglass figure and piled-on  bleached-blonde mane belied an enviable I.Q.  Loni strove for much more as she tried to parlay her newly found fame into a viable dramatic career. She met with a measured degree of success as she recreated the lives of such artificial sex sirens as Mansfield and Thelma Todd on television  but got bogged down in television-movie re-tellings of famous movie classics (Tre soldi nella fontana (1954)  Il terrore corre sul filo (1948)  Femmina folle (1945)) that could not help but pale in comparison. This attempt at seriousness was further hampered by messy tabloid headlines in her private life.Loni Kaye Anderson was born with very dark (jet black) hair on August 5  1945 in St. Paul  Minnesota. An art student at the University of Minnesota  she entered (and won) beauty contests on the sly (including a Miss Minnesota runner-up placing in 1964). Married and divorced before she reached the age of 21  Loni took on a teaching position to support herself and baby daughter (Deidre) while completing college. Developing an interest in acting  she went the route many aspiring thespians do -- apprenticing in local commercials and theater shows. Still dark-haired  she played in several early 1970s productions such as "Born Yesterday" (as Billie Dawn)  "Send Me No Flowers"  "Can-Can" and "The Star-Spangled Girl". She even played "Tzeitel" in "Fiddler on the Roof" and appeared in a production of "The Threepenny Opera".Re-married in 1973 (to another actor  Ross Bickell)  the couple decided to move away from Minnesota to Los Angeles in 1975 and actively pursue film and television work. Pounding the proverbial pavement  she eventually went blonde and this  plus her gorgeous looks  helped her to secure minor but sexy roles on such series as S.W.A.T. - Squadra Speciale Anticrimine (1975)  Pepper Anderson agente speciale (1974)  Barnaby Jones (1973)  Tre cuori in affitto (1976) and The Bob Newhart Show (1972). By the time she nabbed the role of Jennifer Marlowe on "WKRP in Cincinnati" (and  with it  two Emmy nominations)  she had grown quite admirably as an actress.She and Howard Hesseman became the breakaway stars of the sitcom and Loni skyrocketed to sexy status. On the other hand  her instant fame led to the breakup of her second marriage in 1981. Loni found hit-and-miss success outside the parameters of her comedy series. She was front-and-center in a number of television-movies  notably playing tragic Hollywood sex sirens Jayne Mansfield in The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980)  opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger as her muscle-bound husband Mickey Hargitay  and Thelma Todd  in White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd (1991)  whose untimely death in 1935 is still questioned. Loni also appeared lusciously alongside Bob Hope  brightening up several of his classic television specials. On the minus side  she fizzled in her teaming up with equally sexy Wonder Woman (1975) star Lynda Carter in the tepid  short-lived series Fifty/Fifty (1984) and then played a former Las Vegas showgirl who inherits a bundle in the sitcom misfire Quartieri alti (1986). She also was given a chance to work in feature films such as Stroker Ace (1983). While her performance in that film was panned  it did have her meeting and co-starring opposite mega star Burt Reynolds.Appearing in routine  mini-movie soap operas (via her own production company)  if anything  kept Loni in the public eye as a serious-minded actress  but it was an uphill battle to rise above her manufactured image as a fantasy bombshell. Not helping things was her high-profile marriage to Reynolds in 1988  which began blissfully enough (and produced adopted son Quinton)  then dissolved quickly into a nasty divorce that damaged the reputations of both stars. In recent years  Loni has shown incredible perseverance. As always  the stalwart beauty continues to play up the glam but has since downplayed the dramatics. She seems more focused these days on having innocuous fun  playing a number of hearty vixens in sitcoms and series guest spots. Over time  she has enjoyed such lightweight sitcoms as Corsie in allegria (1991)  The Mullets (2003) and as Tori Spelling's materialistic mother in So Notorious (2006)  which did not get the seal of approval from Tori's real-life mother.,1945-08-05,St. Paul  Minnesota  USA,,,3,2

She began doing television commercials  and the blonde  blue-eyed beauty was in great demand for roles; she was a guest-actress once in weekly & family TV series  La famiglia Brady: Never Too Young (1973) and theatrical movie  Shaft (1973).

nm0000770,David Anspaugh,David Anspaugh,,Best known for the inspirational sports dramas Colpo vincente (1986) and Rudy - Il successo di un sogno (1993)  David Anspaugh has enjoyed a long career as a director and producer of film and television. Born in Decatur  Indiana in 1946 to Lawrence Anspaugh  a portrait photographer  and his wife  Marie  he was a member of his high school's football  basketball  and track teams. As a student majoring in secondary education at Indiana University  Anspaugh shot his own short movies and filmed concerts  football games  and Vietnam War protests using a 16mm camera. After graduation he moved to Aspen  Colorado  where he worked as a substitute teacher  waiter  and ski instructor before relocating to Los Angeles to attend film school at the University of Southern California.

He made the transition to feature films when his best friend from IU  Angelo Pizzo  wrote "Hoosiers" and wanted Anspaugh to direct. The scene in "Hoosiers" in which the Hickory Huskers and their coach enter the enormous and empty Butler Fieldhouse was suggested by Anspaugh. Seven years later the two friends reteamed to make the college-football movie "Rudy." Anspaugh insisted on casting Sean Astin in the lead role  even though studio executives wanted someone tall and athletic. And it was Anspaugh's idea to hire NFL Films to shoot the movie's game footage. Anspaugh and Pizzo also collaborated on 1950s World Cup soccer film In campo per la vittoria (2005). Anspaugh has rounded out his career by directing motion pictures and TV movies on many topics other than sports.In 2014 Anspaugh relocated from Santa Monica  California to Bloomington  Indiana  where he taught a class at IU  directed local theater productions  and served as an executive producer on films.,1946-09-24,Decatur  Indiana  USA,,,2,2

nm0000808,Paul Auster,Paul Benjamin Auster,,Paul Auster was born in Newark  New Jersey on February 3rd 1947. His father was a landlord  who owned buildings with his brothers in Jersey City. The family was middle-class and the parents' marriage was not a happy one. Auster grew up in the Newark suburbs of South Orange and Maplewood. He read books enthusiastically and developed an interest for writing.Auster attended high school in Maplewood  some twenty miles southwest of New York City. After his parents' divorce  during his senior year in high school  his mother moved  with his sister and him  to an apartment in the Weequahic section of Newark. Instead of attending his high-school graduation  Auster headed for Europe. He visited Italy  Spain  Paris and naturally James Joyce's Dublin. While he travelled he worked on a novel.He returned to the United States in time to start at Columbia University in the fall. In early 1966 he began his relationship with Lydia Davis. Davis  who is now also a writer  was at that time attending Barnard College and was a good match for Auster's intellect. In 1967 Auster again left the US to attend Columbia's Junior Year Abroad in Paris. Auster became disillusioned with the dull existence within the programme and quit college. But he was still reinstated at Columbia when he returned to New York.Auster's undergraduate years at Columbia coincided with a period of social unrest but he didn't participate actively in student politics. He supported himself with a variety of freelance jobs and wrote articles for university magazines. In June of 1969 Auster was granted a B.A. in English and comparative literature. The following year he received his M.A. from Columbia.A high lottery number saved Auster from having to worry about the Vietnam draft and he took a job with the Census Bureau. During this period he also began work on the novels "In the Country of Last Things" and "Moon Palace"  which he would not complete until many years later. In February 1971 Auster left once again for Paris. He supported himself there with a variety of odd jobs and minor literary tasks. He also worked on several film projects  one of them being in Mexico. In 1973 he moved with Davis to Provence where they became caretakers of a farmhouse.After returning to the US in 1974  Auster has written poems  essays  novels  screenplays and translations. He directed his first motion picture in 1995. He lives in Brooklyn  New York City with his wife and two children.,1947-02-03,Newark  New Jersey  USA,,,1,2
nm0000811,Frankie Avalon,Francis Thomas Avallone,173,One of a spate of teen idols to come out of Philadelphia in the 1950s and 1960s  Frankie Avalon--unlike many of the others--actually had a musical background  having been taught to play the trumpet at a very young age by his father. As a youth Avalon performed in local clubs and theaters. He won a local TV talent contest playing a trumpet solo. In 1951  at age 12  he was in a band called Rocco and the Saints  which included another soon-to-be famous teen singer  Bobby Rydell. In 1952 he was performing at a private party held for singer Al Martino. A talent scout who was also at the party was impressed enough by Avalon to get him an appearance on Jackie Gleason's TV show  which led to more television appearances. In 1954 he made two singles for "X" Records  an RCA Victor subsidiary. Both were instrumentals featuring Avalon playing his trumpet: "Trumpet Sorrento" and ""Trumpet Tarantella." He eventually landed a recording contract with Philadelphia's Chancellor Records  and he recorded "Cupid" and "Teacher's Pet". These records got him his first movie role  a small part in Jamboree! (1957) designed to promote "Teacher's Pet." His next record was "DeDe Dinah"  a song written by his managers (and one for which he had so little respect that he pinched his nose while recording it  resulting in its extremely nasal sound). After an appearance on Dick Clark's teen dance show Bandstand (1952)  sales of the record zoomed and it eventually sold more than a million copies. In 1959  after two more big hits ("Ginger Bread" and "I'll Wait for You") he recorded the song he is probably best known for  the million-selling "Venus." However  as 1960 rolled around his career began to wane and his record sales dropped precipitously. He soon began taking small parts in movies  most notably in John Wayne's La battaglia di Alamo (1960). He began to get somewhat bigger parts and had his first starring role in Tamburi d'Africa (1963). His movie career really took off  however  when he was paired with former Mousketeer Annette Funicello in Vacanze sulla spiaggia (1963) and its string of sequels. These films  with their combination of surfing  low comedy  dancing and "beach bunnies" in bikinis  struck a nerve with teenage audiences  were produced for peanuts and made a fortune. Avalon still recorded songs for Chancellor and other labels  but now he was far better known among younger audiences for his movies than for his records. In 1985 he began touring with fellow teen idols Rydell and Fabian in an oldies show called "The Golden Boys of Bandstand " which was a rousing success. In 1987 he and Funicello were reunited in Tutti al mare (1987)  an homage to  and parody of  their earlier "beach" movies. Avalon still makes personal appearances and tours  many with and for his old friend and mentor Dick Clark.,1940-09-18,Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  USA,,,0,8

nm0000821,Amitabh Bachchan,Amitabh Harivansh Srivastav,183,Son of well known poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Teji Bachchan. He has a brother named Ajitabh. He completed his education from Uttar Pradesh and moved to Bombay to find work as a film star  in vain though  as film-makers preferred someone with a fairer skin  and he was not quite fair enough. But they did use one of his other assets  his deep baritone voice  which was used for narration and background commentary. He was successful in being cast in Saat Hindustani. He got his break in Bollywood after a letter of introduction from the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi  as he was a friend of her son  Rajiv Gandhi. This is how Amitabh made an entry in Bollywood  starting with Zanjeer  co-starred with his future wife Jaya Bhaduri  and since then there has been no looking back.He married Jaya Bhaduri  an accomplished actress in her own right  and they had two children  Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is married  lives a non-filmy life and has two children.Being friends with Rajiv Gandhi  got him to decide to run for seat in the Congress from his hometown but had to leave midterm because of controversies  particularly after Rajiv and he were implicated in the now infamous "Bofors" case along with the U.K. based Hinduja Brothers.After a four year break  he was back in the unsuccessful Mrityudaata (1997)  a comeback which the actor wanted to forget. Critics written him off but his career was saved with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998). But four flops in 1999 and incurring debt of over 90 Crores rupees of his sinking company ABCL saw him at an all-time low. To make matters worse  after the defeat of the Congress party  Amitabh lost considerable political support  the opposition made him a target  and his credit rating deteriorated to such an extent that a leading nationalized bank  Canara Bank  sued him for outstanding loans. He did bounce back  presenting the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire called Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000). After a series of hits with Mohabbatein (2000)  Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003) and La divisa (2004)  this elderly Bachchan is showing no signs of slowing down and proving the critics wrong once again.His son  Abhishek  is also an actor by his own rights.Amitabh and Jaya were interested in getting Abhishek married to Karishma  the daughter of Babita and Randhir Kapoor  they went through a formal engagement  but later broke it off.The former Miss World and Bollywood actress  Aishwarya Rai  and Abhishek  were formally engaged on Sunday January 14  2007  at the Bachchan residence in Juhu  Bombay  with the marriage taking place at the Bachchan residence on April 20  2007.On November 16  2011  he became a Dada (Paternal Grandfather) when Aishwarya gave birth to a daughter in Mumbai Hospital. He is already a Nana (maternal grandfather) to Navya Naveli and Agastye - Shweta's children.He continues to be one of the busiest actors and singers in Bollywood as well as on TV  as can be seen from the commercials that he appears on  especially on Sahara One.

nm0000834,Kathy Baker,Katherine Whitton Baker,168,For someone who has made an award-winning impact in all three mediums (stage  film and TV)  actress Kathy Baker has been strangely denied all-out stardom  yet continues to demonstrate her versatility in whatever material comes her way.The comely blonde was born Katherine Whitton Baker in Midland  Texas  to Helene Andree Baker (nee Whitton) and John Seawand Baker  a geologist and educator who taught at both Princeton and the University of Paris. Raised in New Mexico  she first took to the stage at age 10. Influenced by her French-born mother  Kathy attended the University of California at Berkeley and received her Bachelor of Arts degree in French in 1977  then went to Paris to study haute cuisine at the famed Cordon Bleu. She returned to the States to work as a pastry chef  but discovered that she still wanted to act and eventually joined San Francisco's Magic Theatre  where she appeared in the play "The Man Who Killed the Buddha." Her performance drew the immediate attention of playwright Sam Shepard.1983 was a banner year for Kathy. At the Magic Theatre  wherein she used the stage name of Kathy Whitton Baker  Shepard cast her in a leading role in one of his new plays  "Fool for Love." The premiere garnered exceptional notices and the play (and Kathy) went to New York. She and co-star Ed Harris  won 1984 Obie Awards for their rich performances  as did playwright Shepard for directing. The production itself won the Obie for "Best New American Play." That same year Kathy made a strong movie debut co-starring in Uomini veri (1983) as the wife of astronaut Alan Shepard (played by Scott Glenn).Displaying an attractive intelligence in her performances  Kathy continued to make strides on the New York stage both in 1984's "Desire Under the Elms" and as a replacement for the Lemon character in the Obie-winning "Aunt Dan and Lemon" at Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival in 1986. Later in the decade  both Kathy and Morgan Freeman stole the thunder right from under star Christopher Reeve in the tense film drama Street Smart - Per le strade di New York (1987) with Kathy delivering a grim  heartfelt performance as an ill-fated hooker to Freeman's feral pimp. Both perfs delivered a one-two punch and were applauded for their shocking realism. Each received their share of awards and plaudits; Kathy nabbed both the National Society of Critics and Boston Society of Critics awards  but was shamefully snubbed when it came to the Oscar race (Freeman was nominated  but lost).Throughout the rest of the decade Kathy continued to give spot-on performances in such quality films as Fuori dal tunnel (1988)  as a recovering addict; Il peso del ricordo (1988)  as a wife whose son commits suicide; Jacknife (1989)  in which she was reunited with Ed Harris as the put-upon  plain-Jane sister of an alcoholic Vietnam vet; and Edward mani di forbice (1990) as a seemingly model housewife who has an uncontrollably flirtatious nature. Top-flight stardom seemed to be almost a given.With the new decade  however  the movie roles tendered out to her became less frequent or noteworthy so Kathy decided to focus outside her medium of choice and actively search for TV roles. The results were customarily expert. In the slightly quirky La famiglia Brock (1992)  Kathy found a perfect fit taking on the role of small town mother and doctor Jill Brock. Running for four seasons  she was nominated for an Emmy each year and took home the trophy three of those four times for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series".Into the millennium Kathy has maintained consistency with quality roles in such releases as Prigione di vetro (2001)  Assassination Tango (2002)  Ritorno a Cold Mountain (2003)  9 vite da donna (2005)  Tutti gli uomini del re (2006)  Il club di Jane Austen (2007)  Miss Nobody (2010)  Seven Days in Utopia (2011)  Saving Mr. Banks (2013)  The Ballad of Lefty Brown (2017) and Attraverso i miei occhi (2019). On TV she and Helen Mirren picked up supporting Emmy nods in the bittersweet Il venditore dell'anno (2002)  with Emmy-winning William H. Macy starring as a man with cerebral palsy.In 2001 she joined the cast of Boston Public (2000) as a manipulative mom (another Emmy nomination). Some of those episodes were directed by Steven Robman  whom she married in June of 2003. Kathy has two sons from a previous marriage.In addition to guest spots on such TV series as "Fathers and Son " "Nip/Tuck " "Gilmore Girls  "Grey's Anatomy " "Saving Grace " "Medium" (recurring)  and "Criminal Minds " she had series roles in Against the Wall (2011)  I'm Sorry. (2017) and The Ranch (2016).,1950-06-08,Midland  Texas  USA,,,1,2
nm0000835,Ralph Bakshi,Ralph Bakshi,191,Ralph Bakshi worked his way up from Brooklyn and became an animation legend. He was born on October 29  1938  in Haifa  Israel  the son of Mina (Zlotin) and Eliezar Bakshi  and is of Krymchak Jewish descent. He was raised in Brownsville  after his family came to New York to escape World War II. Bakshi attended the Thomas Jefferson High School and was later transferred to the High School of Industrial Arts and graduated with an award in cartooning in 1957.At the Terrytoons studio  he started as a cel polisher then graduated to cel painting. Practicing nights and weekends  he quickly became an inker and then an animator. There  he worked on such shows as Mighty Mouse  Heckle and Jeckle  Deputy Dawg  Foofle and Lariat Sam. At 28 he created and directed a series of superhero spoof cartoons called The Mighty Heroes.In 1967  Bakshi moved to Paramount Studios. Working with producer Steve Krantz  Bakshi worked on episodes of the Spider-Man TV series and several short films. In the 1970s  Bakshi set out to produce films using his innovative vision for how animated films should be. Krantz suggested Robert Crumb's "Fritz the Cat" comic book as Bakshi's first feature. The two set out to meet with Crumb and get the film rights. In 1972  the film premiered and was extremely successful  as the first feature-length animated film to receive an X rating by the American rating system (when it was distributed worldwide  it generally received lower ratings the equivalent of an R rating  and was released as being unrated on DVD).The success of "Fritz the Cat" allowed Bakshi to produce films featuring his own characters and ideas  and so "Heavy Traffic" and "Coonskin" were produced  both of which were extremely controversial  but were praised by critics. During the same period  he shot and completed another feature titled "Hey Good Lookin'" for the Warner Brothers studio  who didn't think that a combination of live-action and animation would sell  and forced Bakshi to go back and animate the live action sequences.During this period  Bakshi also produced two very successful fantasy films  "Wizards" and part one of an animated film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings." Although these films were financially successful  they were misunderstood by critics  and United Artists  the studio that produced "The Lord of the Rings" refused to fund the second part  or sequel to Bakshi's ambitious adaptation.During the 1980s  animation went into a decline. "American Pop " done using the same style of realistic animation as "The Lord of the Rings" was not successful financially  and critics did not see the point of the film being animated. The finished version of "Hey Good Lookin'" was released during the same year as "American Pop " but was also unsuccessful financially. Bakshi's last film of the decade  "Fire & Ice " a collaboration with famed artist Frank Frazetta  was a flop.Bakshi produced several television features with mixed results before returning to film with what would eventually become "Cool World" - the script was rewritten several times during production without Bakshi's knowledge until it came to the point where Bakshi did not recognize his own work. The film was critically scorned  and was a box office flop. Fans feel that the film is not a true Bakshi film.Since then  the Internet and DVD releases of Bakshi's work have brought him a new generation of fans and increased interest  encouraging Bakshi to produce another film. "Last Days of Coney Island" is in production. Bakshi lives in New Mexico. A three-day retrospective was held at American Cinematheque at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood  California and the Aero Theater in Santa Monica  California in April  2005.,1938-10-29,Haifa  Palestine [now Israel],,,1,4

nm0000864,Mikhail Baryshnikov,Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov,170,Boyishly cute  diminutive and strong as a bull  but as graceful as any gazelle or swan  Mikhail Baryshnikov is a household name even to non-balletomanes. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and biggest names in dance.Mikhail began his ballet studies in his native Riga  Latvia. He was accepted by the Leningrad Choreographic School  the associate school of the Kirov Ballet. One of his instructors there was Alexander Pushkin  who had taught Rudolf Nureyev - who defected in Paris and was already making a name for himself in America. Among Baryshnikov's friends at the school were Alexander Godunov (nicknamed Sasha) and "ballerina assoluta" Natalia Makarova.Mikhail joined the Kirov Ballet of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and his technique and balletic abilities were so great  he skipped the corps and was immediately put in a soloist position. While doing quite well in Russia  even finding an audience fanbase  the government and dance seemed to be too limiting and frustrating for him. Like other Russian dancers before him and after him  he would soon defect.When the Kirov was touring in Canada  Baryshnikov defected and then quickly became a member of the National Ballet of Canada. Later on  he joined the American Ballet Theatre becoming one of the company's principal dancers. During this time he was reintroduced to 'Gelsey Kirkland' of New York City Ballet  whom he had previously met in Russia  becoming partners both on the stage and in real life. The celebrated partnership went on to become legendary  with their most well-known work being Baryshnikov's version of Tchaikovsky's ballet "The Nutcracker".In 1977  Mikhail made his film debut in Due vite una svolta (1977)  a part written especially for him  where he played Yuri  a superstar ballet defector from Russia who beds more ballerinas than he dances with. Gelsey was also slated to co-star  but she wanted "no part of Hollywood"  had objections to the storyline and soon after the two split. The movie went on to be nominated for 11 Oscars  including one for Mikhail.Throughout his life Mikhail had idolized George Balanchine  the great choreographer and ballet master of the early 20th century for his innovation within the art of modern ballet. Thus  in addition to his occasional casting in films  Baryshnikov applied to and became a student of the great Balanchine  learning his choreography styles  taking a sabbatical from the ABT. Mikhail danced "Prodigal Son" and numerous other ballets at NYCB under Balanchine's direction and continued with NYCB until he was offered the position of Artistic Director at ABT. He briefly resumed the role of principal dancer  but was forced to quit professional ballet due to injuries. In the 1990's  he co-founded the White Oak Dance Project  and in 2000 received a lifetime of achievement award at the Kennedy Center Honor Awards.Baryshnikov has been called the greatest male dancer of the 20th century and continues to dance  model and act  both in film and in the theater.,1948-01-27,Riga  Latvia  USSR [now Latvia],,,0,0

nm0000870,Kathy Bates,Kathleen Doyle Bates,160,Multi-talented  multi-award-winning actress Kathleen (Doyle) Bates was born on June 28  1948  and raised in Memphis  Tennessee. She is the youngest of three girls born to Bertye Kathleen (Talbot)  a homemaker  and Langdon Doyle Bates  a mechanical engineer. Her grandfather was author Finis L. Bates. Kathy has English  as well as Irish  Scottish  and German  ancestry  and one of her ancestors  an Irish emigrant to New Orleans  once served as President Andrew Jackson's doctor.Kathy discovered acting appearing in high school plays and studied drama at Southern Methodist University  graduating in 1969. With her mind firmly set  she moved to New York City in 1970 and paid her dues by working everything from a cash register to taking lunch orders. Things started moving quickly up the ladder after giving a tour-de-force performance alongside Christopher Walken at Buffalo's Studio Arena Theatre in Lanford Wilson's world premiere of "Lemon Sky" in 1970  but she also had a foreshadowing of the heartbreak to come after the successful show relocated to New York's off-Broadway Playhouse Theatre without her and Walken wound up winning a Drama Desk award.By the mid-to-late 1970s  Kathy was treading the boards frequently as a rising young actress of the New York and regional theater scene. She appeared in "Casserole" and "A Quality of Mercy" (both 1975) before earning exceptional reviews for her role of Joanne in "Vanities". She took her first Broadway curtain call in 1980's "Goodbye Fidel " which lasted only six performances. She then went directly into replacement mode when she joined the cast of the already-established and highly successful "Fifth of July" in 1981.Kathy made a false start in films with Taking Off (1971)  in which she was billed as "Bobo Bates". She didn't film again until Vigilato speciale (1978)  starring Dustin Hoffman  and that part was not substantial enough to cause a stir. Things turned hopeful  however  when Kathy and the rest of the female ensemble were given the chance to play their respective Broadway parts in the film version of Robert Altman's Jimmy Dean  Jimmy Dean (1982). It was a juicy role for Kathy and film audiences finally started noticing the now 34-year-old.Still and all  it was the New York stage that continued to earn Kathy awards and acclaim. She was pure textbook to any actor studying how to disappear into a role. Her characters ranged from free and life-affirming to downright pitiable. Despite winning a Tony Award nomination and Outer Critic's Circle Award for her stark  touchingly sad portrait of a suicidal daughter in 1983's "'night  Mother" and the Obie and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for her powerhouse job as a romantic misfit in "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune " Kathy had no box-office pull  however  and was never a strong consideration when the roles transferred to the screen. Her award-winning stage went to established film stars. First Sissy Spacek took over her potent role as the suicidal Jessie Cates in Una finestra nella notte (1986)  then Michelle Pfeiffer seized the moment to play her dumpy lover character in Paura d'amare (1991). It would take Oscar glory to finally rectify the injustice.It was Kathy's fanatical turn as the drab  chunky  porcine-looking psychopath Annie Wilkes  who kidnaps her favorite author (James Caan) and subjects him to a series of horrific tortures  that finally turned the tide for her in Hollywood. With the 1990 shocker Misery non deve morire (1990)  based on the popular Stephen King novel  Bates and Caan were box office magic. Moreover  Kathy captured the "Best Actress" Oscar and Golden Globe award  a first in that genre (horror) for that category. To add to her happiness she married Tony Campisi  also an actor  in 1991.Quality film scripts now started coming her way and the 1990s proved to be a rich and rewarding time for her. First  she and another older "overnight" film star  fellow Oscar winner Jessica Tandy  starred together in the modern portion of the beautifully nuanced  flashback period piece Pomodori verdi fritti alla fermata del treno (1991). She then outdid herself as the detached and depressed housekeeper accused of murdering her abusive husband (David Strathairn) in L'ultima eclissi (1995). Surprisingly  she was left out of the Oscar race for these two excellent performances. Not so  however  for her flashy political advisor Libby Holden in the movie I colori della vittoria (1998)  receiving praise and a "Best Supporting Actress" nomination.Kathy has continued to work prolifically on TV as a 14-time Emmy winner or nominee thus far. She has also taken to directing a couple of TV-movies on the sly. As most actors  she has been in hit and miss TV shows. On the hit side  she has earned a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Jay Leno's manager playing tough politics in The Late Shift (1996) and played to the hilt the cruel-minded orphanage operator  Miss Hannigan  in The Wonderful World of Disney: Annie (1999) for which she also earned an Emmy nom. She has done some eye-catching  offbeat turns on regular series such as Six Feet Under (2001) (for which she also earned a DGA award for helming an episode)  The Office (2005)  Harry's Law (2011) and especially American Horror Story (2011) for which she won an Emmy as Ethel Darling. She also won an Emmy for a guest episode on the hit sitcom Due uomini e mezzo (2003).Interesting millennium filming have included a Catholic school's Mother Superior in the comic drama Bruno (2000); Jesse James' mother in Gli ultimi fuorilegge (2001); a quirky  liberal mom in A proposito di Schmidt (2002) for which she earned another "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar nomination; a brief but potent turn as Gertrude Stein in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011); Queen Victoria in the adventurous remake of Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (2004); wacky parent types in the comedies A casa con i suoi (2006) and Relative Strangers - Aiuto! sono arrivati i miei (2006); Mother Claus in the seasonal farce Fred Claus - Un fratello sotto l'albero (2007); an over-gushy foster mother in the dramedy La grande Gilly Hopkins (2015); and a wrenching performance as the mother of a suspected terrorist in Richard Jewell (2019) for which she earned her third "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar nomination.Divorced from husband Campisi since 1997  Kathy has been the Executive Committee Chair of the Actors Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors.,1948-06-28,Memphis  Tennessee  USA,,,1,0

Bauchau plays the villain the Bond flick  "A View to a Kill" and has starring roles in Entre Nous and The Music Teacher  both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film In 1996. Bauchau was cast in the television series "Kindred: The Embraced" as a patriarch of the living dead; while the series lasted only a few weeks  it did lead to the series regular role of Sydney in "The Pretender"  which debuted the same year and ran for four seasons on NBC. Bauchau's higher profile in television helped him win notable roles in high-profile films such as "Clear and Present Danger"  "The Cell"  "Ray" and "Panic Room". Bauchau also plays notable roles in the independent features "The Five Obstructions"  "Twin Falls Idaho"  "The Secretary"  "Boy Culture" and "The Gray Man" among several others.

nm0000903,Brian Benben,Brian Edward Benben,168,Charming  compactly built  extremely affable American actor Brian Edward Benben was born on June 18  1956  in Winchester  Virginia  to Gloria Patricia (Coffman) and Peter Michael Benben  Sr.  a produce buyer. His paternal grandparents were Polish.Deciding on an acting career while quite young  he started things out at age 17 performing in off-off-Broadway shows in New York. Such late 1970s theater works included "Wild Oats " "The Tooth of Crime " "The Overcoat " "Gossip " "A Moon for the Misbegotten" and the role of Bottom in "A Midsummer Night's Dream".During his early twenties he began to pursue TV work and made an auspicious debut on the very serious side with the infamous I giorni del Padrino (1981)  in which his Michael Lasker character was a barely disguised version of real-life mobster Meyer Lansky. He also played a gay lover in the TV movie drama American Playhouse: Family Business (1983)  starring a straight-acting Milton Berle  and then portrayed Tom Hayden  the California senator who was once convicted  along with others  of inciting riots that disrupted the 1968 Democratic National Convention  in the redramatization of Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8 (1987). Brian also had supporting roles that also accentuated his serious side  in the feature films Fuori dal tunnel (1988)  Arma non convenzionale (1990) and Mortal Sins (1989).He got regular series work in the late 1980s playing a chauvinistic hospital resident who felt women had no place being surgeons on the short-lived medical drama Kay O'Brien (1986). But it was the sexually frank sitcom Dream On (1990) that catapulted Brian to stardom as the self-effacing  newly divorced book editor Martin Tupper. The cable show  which took on a whimsical  if much more hormonal  Thurber-like feel  lasted six seasons. During that run he was given a choice starring part in the film Benvenuti a Radioland (1994). Had the series been on a first-rank network (it was on Fox briefly in 1995)  his star power might have luminesced even more brightly. Nevertheless  this led to his second starring sitcom role  in which he used his real name to play a news co-anchor  on the very aptly titled The Brian Benben Show (1998) for CBS. The show  for which he was co-executive producer  had a much shorter life than "Dream On".Since then  Brian has maintained amenably on TV  particularly in mini-movies. He was found mixing it up with Diane Keaton in the irreverent Sister Mary Explains It All (2001)  playing at odds with William Hurt in the drama The Flamingo Rising (2001) and returning to his mob roots in the mini-series Kingpin (2003)  this time as a morally tormented surgeon. Other series work included a doctor in the "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff Private Practice (2007) and a clever grifter in Imposters (2017) On stage  Brian took his initial Broadway bow in "Slab Boys" alongside Sean Penn  Kevin Bacon and Val Kilmer.Brian has been married since 1982 to actress Madeleine Stowe  who played his wife Ruth Lasker in the "Gangster" series.

nm0000918,Helmut Berger,Helmut Steinberger,184,Helmut Berger - Austrian born film actor  mostly known for starring in Luchino Visconti's films  which are now considered modern classics. Born Helmut Steinberger in Salzburg in 1944  he turned down a prospect of running a family hotel business and went to London where he worked as waiter to pay his way through drama school. Later he attended the University of Perugia in Italy and spent some time in France. His acting career began with French and Italian commercials and showed no signs of progress until he was picked up by Luchino Visconti out of pool of "extras" during the shooting of Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa... (1965) in 1964. Berger's relationships with Visconti  whose partner he remained for 12 years  brought him to the attention of press and allowed him to act in some Visconti's films such as La caduta degli Dei (1969) ("The Damned)  Ludwig (1973) and Gruppo di famiglia in un interno (1974) ("The Conversation Piece"). Visconti is said to view Berger as the very image of his idea of a "demonic  insane and sexually perverted" man. As a matter of fact Berger often portrayed anguished souls and sinister villains. His acting career continued throughout the 1970s but was temporarily broken up in the early 80s when he battled alcohol problem. He appeared in numerous French  Italian  German films and spent one season on American soap Dynasty (1981) but few directors used his gifts with the same skill as Visconti. His autobiography "Ich" (Me)  in which he famously referred to his relationships with Visconti as "marriage" and claimed to be the director's widow  appeared in 1998. Berger is still very active appearing in TV series regularly. He also very modestly attributed his acting achievements to Visconti's directing.,1944-05-29,Bad Ischl  Upper Austria  Austria,,,0,0

nm0000928,Sandra Bernhard,Sandra Gail Bernhard,178,Love her or hate her  this comic diva is a one-of-a-kind  in-your-face  take-no-prisoners artiste. Racy  confrontational  offensive  cynical  off-putting and angst-ridden to a T  this flinty stand-up from Flint  Michigan was born on June 6  1955  the daughter of Jerome Bernhard  a proctologist  and his wife Jeanette  an abstract painter  sculptor and photographer who later divorced after 38 years. Moving to Scottsdale  Arizona in her early years  her initial comedy stage work in the 1970s was formulated around her "fish out of water" existence growing up as a "Jewess" amongst a sea of "blonde WASPs". A conventional beauty she was not. Her angular build was hardly complemented by angry  pronounced features  notably a trademark slash of a mouth. She managed to survive high school and went to live on a kibbutz in Israel for a period of time. Moving to Los Angeles at age 19  she paid her rent by working as a beauty salon manicurist to the stars as she tried to make a semi-name for herself in such L.A. haunts as "The Comedy Store." It all began quite modestly at an open-mike night at Ye Little Club in Beverly Hills in 1975.As Bernhard grew in stature  the girl with major attitude was soon getting noticed for TV. She  along with other up-and-coming comics such as Robin Williams and Marsha Warfield  was cast as a regular player on The Richard Pryor Show (1977)  a musical variety show. Her cutting-edge humor seemed like a natural fit in an atmosphere provided by a daredevil like Pryor  but the censorship staff and a turned-off audience had the show taken off the air after only five shows. A gifted talker and raconteur  she started making news on the night time talk show circuit for her pungent comments and observances.She demonstrated real chutzpah on camera after Martin Scorsese cast her as Masha  who loose cannon who stalks and covets a talk show host  in his film Re per una notte (1982) starring Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis. Nothing  however  came out of this dark success and she instead focused on the possibility of doing a one-woman comedy show.Her first solo piece was entitled "I'm Your Woman" in 1985 and was met with a so-so reception and followed by an unsuccessful album release. Undaunted  Bernhard continued to work on film and TV while crafting a more volatile  performance art-oriented show for shock effect. This came in the form of the off-Broadway 1988 piece "Without You I'm Nothing" which played at the Orpheum Theatre. It was a cult hit and immortalized into both a film  also called Without You I'm Nothing (1990)  and a double-album. As a monologist  Sandra trademark blending of pop culture topics along with blatant social commentary is usually given a boost by a bluesy-styled song.Bernhard could also make eye-catching news on TV. In 1991 she was cast as Nancy Bartlett on the hit sitcom Pappa e ciccia (1988) as one of the first actresses to portray an openly lesbian character on American series TV. Although the character grew more diluted with time  it was nevertheless a groundbreaking character and she appeared on several seasons of the popular show. She did tough-talking turns on such popular shows as "Chicago Hope " "Ally McBeal " "Will & Grace" and "The L Word". Elsewhere  in September of 1992  Sandra opted to do a nude pictorial for Playboy Magazine. She then went on to host the USA network's Reel Wild Cinema (1995) for two seasons. Her brief nudges into mainstream films  which included such bombs Hudson Hawk - Il mago del furto (1991) and Dallas Doll (1994)  did nothing to advance her movie career. Her one-woman shows  however  continue to jell with her liberal following and she enjoyed another New York success with her solo piece "I'm Still Here... Damn It!"  which was also filmed. She also performed off-Broadway in "Sandra Bernhard: Everything Bad and Beautiful."At age 50+  Sandra continues to push the envelope on such shows as "The View." Fair game includes everyone from Mariah Carey to Laura Bush to Mother Teresa as the object of her venom. In fact  she pretty much pioneered the celebrity put-down format that has made infamous celebrities out of such comics as Kathy Griffin. It's Sandra's unique brand of crass talk and self-effacing vulnerability that will keep the "Empress of Acerbity" a strong commodity in the nitery circuit.Unmarried with a young daughter  Sandra is openly bisexual and currently living with a longtime companion  writer and PR executive Sara Switzer. Sara was attached to Sandra's talk show The Sandra Bernhard Experience (2001) as a writer and co-host.,1955-06-06,Flint  Michigan  USA,,,0,0
nm0000929,Corbin Bernsen,Corbin Dean Bernsen,180,Corbin Bernsen made his initial mark on the seminal television series L.A. Law as opportunistic divorce lawyer "Arnie Becker" earning him multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations over the show's eight-year run. He proved along the way the role was not to be a dead-end stereotype  maintaining a steady career in both television and film over the course of three decades. Moreover  his intent devotion to his career and love for the craft has compelled him in recent years to climb into the producer/writer  and director's chair.Born in North Hollywood  California  on September 7  1954  Corbin was raised in and around the entertainment business. The eldest of three children  his father film and television producer Harry Bernsen and mother  veteran actress Jeanne Cooper encouraged him to continue the family tradition. After high school he originally attended UCLA with the intention of pursuing law  but instead  he went on to receive a BFA in Theatre Arts and MFA in Playwriting. He worked on the Equity-waiver L.A. stage circuit as both actor and set designer  making his film debut as a bit player in his father's picture Three the Hard Way. He then set his sights on New York in the late 70s. In the early years he carved out a living as a carpenter building rooftop decks in NYC that still stand to this day. Then in 1983 he landed the role of "Ken Graham" on daytime's Ryan's Hope and he put his tool belt away. This break led to an exclusive deal with NBC and eventually the TV role in L.A. Law. The perks of his "newly-found stardom" on L.A. Law included a hosting stint on Saturday Night Live and the covers of numerous major magazines.Not one to settle for what he knew could be fleeting comfort  he worked diligently to parlay his small screen success into a diverse resume of feature film roles  both starring and supporting  often enjoying the challenge of portraying unsympathetic characters with an infusion of charm and likability. He co-starred as Shelley Long's egotistical husband in the reincarnation comedy Hello Again; played an equally vain Hollywood star in the musical comedy Bert Rigby  You're a Fool; and starred as a disorganized ringleader of a band of crooks in the bank caper Disorganized Crime. He capped the 1980s decade opposite Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger in the box office hit Major League  which took advantage of his natural athleticism  playing ballplayer-cum-owner "Roger Dorn". Two sequels followed. Other notable feature film work includes the mystery thriller Shattered  directed by Wolfgang Peterson  which re-teamed him with Tom Berenger  Stephen Frears' Lay The Favorite  and a turn opposite Robert Downey Jr. in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.On the TV front  he has appeared in many MOW's including Line of Fire: The Morris Dees Story as the famed civil rights attorney who founded the Southern Poverty Law Center. Topping it off  Corbin's title role in the horror/ thriller The Dentist for HBO had audiences developing a similar paranoia of tooth doctors as Anthony Perkins invoked decades before to motel clerks. As spurned husband-turned-crazed dentist "Dr. Alan Feinstone"  Corbin reached cult horror status. The movie spawned a sequel in which he also served as a producer. Most recently  he has reunited with Dentist director Brian Yuzna on a slate of films exploring similar themes starting with "The Plastic Surgeon."More recently Bernsen wrapped eight seasons on USA Network's hit series Psych as Henry Spencer playing James Roday's retired cop father who taught his "fake psychic " crime solving son everything he knows.In 2006 he formed his own production company  Team Cherokee Productions to exert more creative control over his projects and begin exploring material both as writer  director and producer. Today that company has taken root as Home Theater Films  an early player in the Faith and Family film genre. The company has explored a wide variety of themes beginning with the film "Rust" which was distributed by Sony Pictures. With five other films under their belt  including "25 Hill " "Beyond the Heavens " "Christian Mingle" starring Lacey Chabert  and the upcoming "Jesse and Naomi " Home Theater Films has firmly carved a niche and name in this lucrative genre.Corbin has been happily married (since 1988) to British actress Amanda Pays who most recently be seen on "The Flash." They have appeared together in the sci-fi film Spacejacked and the TV-movies Dead on the Money and The Santa Trap  among others. The couple has four sons. Never one to become complacent or fall prey to the hype - a lesson learned from his mother - he still practices his carpenter skills at home as he continues to write  produce  and direct. Perseverance and dedication has played a large part in his continued success. Having a savvy take-charge approach hasn't hurt either -- characteristics worthy of many of the characters he's explored on screen.,1954-09-07,North Hollywood  Los Angeles  California  USA,,,1,4

nm0000932,Halle Berry,Maria Halle Berry,165,Halle Berry was born in Cleveland  Ohio. Her father  Jerome Jesse Berry  was African-American  and worked as a hospital attendant. Her mother  Judith Ann (Hawkins)  who is Caucasian  has English and German ancestry  and is a retired psychiatric nurse. Halle has an older sister  Heidi Berry. Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant  representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and  a year later in 1986  when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant  Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series  1989's Living Dolls (1989)  where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity  preferring to "live" her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough.

She made her feature film debut in Paradise Road (1997).Cate married writer Andrew Upton in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set  and they didn't like each other at first. He thought she was aloof  and she thought he was arrogant  but then they connected over a poker game at a party  and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in Elizabeth (1998) for which she won numerous awards for her performance  including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow. 2001 was a particularly busy year  with starring roles in Bandits (2001)  The Shipping News - Ombre dal profondo (2001)  Charlotte Gray (2001) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy.

She ended her job as artistic director of the Sydney Theatre Company  while her husband continued there for two more years before he too resigned.In 2015  she adopted her daughter Edith in her father's homeland of the United States. That same year  she and her husband sold their multi-million dollar home in Australia at a profit and moved to America.

She played the title role of Carol (2015)  a 1950s American housewife in a lesbian affair with a younger woman  for which she received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. While most actresses might slow down in their forties  Blanchett did the opposite by stretching her boundaries even further  such as when she played 13 different characters in Manifesto (2015) and then making her Broadway debut in 2017 in "The Present"  which is her husband's adaptation of Chekhov's play "Platonov" for which she earned a Tony nomination as Best Actress in a Play.

nm0000954,Jon Bon Jovi,John Francis Bongiovi Jr.,175,Jon Bon Jovi  was born John Francis Bongiovi  Jr. On March 2  1962  in Perth Amboy  New Jersey to parents John Francis Bongiovi  Sr. and Carol Sharkey. Family: Jon's mother  Carol Sharkey  was a former model and one of the first Playboy Bunnies. She met Bon Jovi's father after she enlisted in the United States Marines. John was already in the Marines when they met.Bon Jovi is also a blood relative to the late great singer Frank Sinatra  who was Bon Jovi's great uncle on his father's side  according to a May 1988 issue of Spin Magazine (page 22).Bon Jovi has two brothers  Anthony and Matthew. Bon Jovi has four children  and is married to Dorothea Hurley (1989-present).Known best as a singer-songwriter  in 1983 he was the founder and frontman of a band that bears his name. Bon Jovi is also known as a record producer  actor and philanthropist. Music Career: Bon Jovi's music career started in June of 1982 after he was turned down by several record labels  including Atlantic Records and Mercury (Polygram) for the song "Runaway" which he recorded with a studio band named "The Allstars."After being turned down he visited New York City's major market rock station WAPP  also known as "The Apple" at 103.5FM. WAPP included the song on a compilation of local talent and it became in instant hit.In 1983 he signed with Mercury Records to promote "Runaway" and had to form a new band. Jon Bon Jovi became David Bryan  Alec John Such  bassist  Tico Torres  drummer  and his neighbor  Dave Sabo at lead guitar. Sabo played only a few local shows before he left to form the group Skid Row with Rachel Bolan. Sabo was soon replaced with Richie Sambora.After "Runaway" became a worldwide hit  Bon Jovi wanted a name for the band. He wanted to call themselves Johnny Electric. But Richard Fischer  employed then by Doc McGhee  suggested that Bon Jovi follow the norm where many bands were naming their groups by the lead or frontman' name  such as  Van Halen  Dokken  Bryan Adams  Alice Cooper (70's)  so Bon Jovi became the name of the band.The band's breakout album  "Slippery When Wet " was their third studio album released in 1986. It became the band's best-selling album  selling more than 28 million worldwide  according to a Jan. 29  2008 issue of the Daily Telegraph.Bon Jovi's next album  "New Jersey " not only shared the same success as "Slippery When Wet " the album had five top-10 hits on Billboard's Hot-100. No other album or artist ever produced as many top-10 hits  and as of this writing (September 4  2016) this record still stands. And two of the top-10 hits  "Bad Medicine" and "I'll Be There For You" topped the charts at number one  according to Bon Jovi's Biography on the Billboard website.The band then went on an 18-month international tour  and when they finished  the band went on a hiatus. Hiatus and Young Guns II: During the hiatus  Bon Jovi was hired to write the soundtrack for the movie "Young Guns II." During this time actor Emilio Estevez approached Bon Jovi and asked if he could use "Wanted  Dead or Alive" as the title song for the movie.Bon Jovi balked at the idea  saying he didn't think that song was the proper song  so he quickly wrote "Blaze of Glory."As the story goes  Kiefer Sutherland in an interview for UNCUT magazine said; "When Jon (Bon Jovi) joined the team for Young Guns II  we were all eating hamburgers in a diner and Jon was scribbling on this napkin for  say  six minutes. He declared he'd written 'Blaze of Glory'  which of course then went through the roof in the States. He later gave Emilio Estevez the napkin. We were munching burgers while he wrote a No. 1 song... Made us feel stupid."Afterwards  Bon Jovi played the song in a New Mexico desert for Estevez and John Fusco. This was the first time Bon Jovi played the song and heard by anyone. When the co-producers heard the song in a trailer  it was a no-brainer. It became the theme song for "Young Guns II.""Young Guns II " which was released in 1990 named which Bon Jovi made into his next album "Blaze of Glory." This was Bon Jovi's first solo album as the other band members were off doing other things during the hiatus.The movie's budget was $20 million and went on to earn $44 million. Two hits came from this album  "Blaze of Glory" and Miracle." Bon Jovi earned several Grammy and Oscar nominations.While he wrote a song or two for a couple of shows before this  this was his first and only project where he wrote every song for a movie's soundtrack. He did go on to write songs for other movies  and many of the group's songs were used in a variety of TV series. Back Together (Kind Of): During the years from their first hit "Runaway" in 1982  the group has released 12 studio albums and Bon Jovi recorded two solo albums and a number of singles. Worldwide  his band has sold more than 130 albums  ranking them among the top of the best sellers.But the band isn't sitting around and resting. In 2015 there were rumors of a planned new album to be released sometime in 2016.Rumors used to spread like wildfires  but today  the Internet allows them to travel at the speed of light. Talk about a new album for 2016 was confirmed by a consultant  and another world tour would follow.On September 30  2015  Bon Jovi said during a press conference confirming the new album  its title will be "This House Is Not For Sale." He further said that the album is about the group's integrity."Integrity matters and we're at a place in our career where we don't have anything left to prove " Bon Jovi said.However  the new album is the first one without creative input from Richie Sambora  who left the group in 2013.On Bon Jovi's Facebook page  a post announced that the new album  "This House Is Not For Sale" was released on August 27  2016 Acting Career: He started acting in the 1990's starring in minor roles in movies such as "U-571 " and "Moonlight and Valentino " and as Helen Hunt's husband in the movie "Pay It Forward" starring Kevin Spacey. He also appeared on several TV shows such as "Sex and the City" and "Ally McBeal."

He has always had a creative mind and good mentality for camera techniques and soon got into film as a popular cinematographer. He worked on a huge number of films before finding himself on the production of the film Speed (1994)  which became his first as a director. The film was a success and took him onto the next set for Twister (1996)  which he also directed. But then the total flops started coming his way: firstly  Speed 2 - Senza limiti (1997)  which he wrote and directed but without the company of Keanu Reeves. He also directed the star-packed Haunting - Presenze (1999) but that also failed him at the Box Office.Later  Jan directed Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - La culla della vita (2003)  and is still active in cinema.

There  he started as assistant but worked later as director on documentaries  such as The Newcomers (1964). His friendship with Lee Marvin allowed him to work in Hollywood (e.g. Senza un attimo di tregua (1967) and Duello nel Pacifico (1968)) from where he returned to the UK (e.g. Leone l'ultimo (1970)  Zardoz (1974) or L'esorcista II - L'eretico (1977)). He became famous for Excalibur (1981)  La foresta di smeraldo (1985) and his autobiographic story Anni '40 (1987) where he tells his own experiences as a child after World War II and which brought him another Academy Award Nomination after Un tranquillo weekend di paura (1972).,1933-01-18,Rosehill  Carshalton  Surrey  England  UK,,,1,7
nm0000961,Timothy Bottoms,Timothy James Bottoms,180,From a talented acting generation of brothers  Timothy James Bottoms  who was this close to out-and-out super-stardom in the 1970s  is the oldest of four acting siblings. All four boys were born in Santa Barbara  California (Timothy on August 30  1951; some sources indicate 1950)  as children of James "Bud" Bottoms  a sculptor and high school art teacher  and his wife Betty. Artistic expression was certainly encouraged in this family and Timothy expressed an avid interest  even during his preschool years  of wanting to perform. Raised in Santa Barbara  he was a member of the Youth Theater Productions at school and in 1967 toured Europe along with the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society  which sealed his aspirations.Following high school  Timothy was spotted by Universal in a stage production of "Romeo and Juliet" and chosen (with no prior film experience) for a lead part in director Dalton Trumbo's E Johnny prese il fucile (1971). As Joe  a young American soldier who is shelled and left armless and legless on the last day of World War I  Timothy received excellent reviews and earned a Golden Globe nomination as "Most Promising Newcomer." His next starring role propelled him into the top leagues. Cast as aimless Texas-boy "Sonny " the sensitive  mournful-eyed  youthful focus of Peter Bogdanovich's downbeat Oscar winner L'ultimo spettacolo (1971)  the film went on to make full-fledged stars not only of Timothy  but of Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd. Younger brother Sam  who frequently visited the set  wound up touchingly cast as another young but ill-fated character.The early 1970s was a time of great personal accomplishments for Bottoms in film. Engagingly maladroit and looking slightly uncomfortable in his own skin  he proved that his first reviews were no flukes. He appeared to great advantage in the touching drama Amore e dolore e tutto quel dannato pasticcio (1973) opposite British acting doyenne Maggie Smith and as the tousle-haired college protagonist in the coming-of-age box-office hit Esami per la vita (1973). In an effort to break free of his sensitive prototype  he delved into stranger  darker characters with The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) and Rollercoaster il grande brivido (1977). These efforts were less successful  however  and he quickly began to discover his film career slipping away at the early age of 26.Outgrowing his awkward adorableness  he shifted to the smaller screen in order to secure challenging roles  such as the biblical lead in The Story of David (1976); his ex-convict in Caccia aperta (1976); his bank teller in Arthur Hailey's the Moneychangers (1976); his fatally-stricken track runner in A Shining Season (1979)  and the Raymond Massey role (in which he aged 30 years) in the ambitious mini-series La valle dell'Eden (1981)  with brother Sam recreating the James Dean part.Timothy's success certainly encouraged his younger siblings. By this time Joseph  Sam and Ben were were all experiencing significant lifts in their own respective careers. As a group  the four brothers hooked up together for the TV movie Island Sons (1987)  in which they all played brothers and used their real first names. The movie was promoted as a pilot for an upcoming weekly series  but it failed to make the grade. While Timothy continued to work steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s  the quality of material he was given grew more standard. Roles in such films as Invaders (1986)  The Drifter (1988) and the foreign-made Istanbul (1989) did little to reignite his earlier success. A sequel to his famous "The Last Picture Show"  entitled Texasville (1990)  could have had heads turning but the movie decided instead to focus instead on Jeff Bridges (who at this juncture was a big name star) while Timothy's character was given short shrift with what was essentially a cameo.Into the millennium Timothy had a slight taste of his former glory while showing a keen talent for parody with his uncanny impersonation of president George W. Bush. Who would have thought? Bottoms' dead-on spoof on That's My Bush! (2001)  courtesy of the creators of "South Park"  led to a brief Bush cameo in the family film Missione coccodrillo (2002) and the much more serious TV-movie DC 9/11: Time of Crisis (2003). Interestingly  Timothy needed little in the way of prosthetics. He simply parted his hair differently  added a bit of a drawl and imitated his walk!The still boyish-looking actor with that same trickle of sadness and discomfort has worked continuously for the past thirty years and appeared in over 65 films. Of late he has shined in small independent features such as with his dysfunctional father in Gus Van Sant Elephant (2003)  which chronicled a Columbine High School-like massacre  and his closer-to-home portrayal as a middle-aged actor in search of his early fame in Paradise  Texas (2006). More recently is a role in the remake of Jack London's Il richiamo della foresta (2009).Timothy's marriage to folk singer Alicia Cory from 1975 to 1978  produced son Bartholomew. He has three other children (Benton  William  Bridget) with current wife (since 1984) Marcia Morehart. Bottoms divides his time between his acting work and his other great love of training wild horses at his two ranches near Big Sur  California. On the sly he has worked as a surveyor's assistant. While two of his brothers  Joseph and Ben  have virtually abandoned their film careers for satisfying lives outside the Hollywood realm  Sam died at 53 of brain cancer. Timothy continues to pursue his Hollywood career decided to venture on.,1951-08-30,Santa Barbara  California  USA,,,2,4

His childhood similar to a "military brat"  a series of strung-together extended-stay location shoots  alternating with tours on the road with his father's various bands and associates. In a world of gypsies & artists  spending many years on tour buses and side-stage-studying such acts as Willie Nelson  Leon Russell  Little Feat  the Band  and Fleetwood Mac  Jake found his passion for music and performing live.Busey entered the industry at the age of 5 in his first motion picture  Dustin Hoffman's opus  "Straight Time" (1977) playing Son to his father and Cathy Bates  . After finishing high school at Crossroads School  and college in Santa Barbara   Jake returned to L.A to study the craft of acting for film seriously. He started auditioning at 20yrs old  and booked his first role in a PBS film  "Shimmer"  shot on location in Iowa. Slowly but surely bit parts playing supporting characters in independent films would follow. After a few years of hard work and little returns  He was Cast as the villain in Showtimes "rebel highway series" Motorcycle Gang  by Director John Milius. The film was part of an 8 film series  and drew great attention amongst the "up and coming actor" buzz of hollywood. He made his true debut to the big screen in 1994 alongside Stephen Dorff and Reese Witherspoon in grind house grunge film "SFW"  but that Buzz caught the eye of Robert Zemekis & Peter Jackson which led jake to star opposite Michael J. Fox in the Frighteners. .soon after wrapping  big changes came from a 3 page monologue about religion vs. science  when he landed "Contact" with Jodi Foster and Matthew McConnaghey. Then "Enemy of the State"  then Vince Gilligan scribed "Home Fries " and most memorably as the smart-mouthed Private Ace Levy in the Sci-Fi cult classic "Starship Troopers." Jake was a force to be reckoned with in the late 1990's A-list film market. Then in the early 21st century  after the great success of "Identity"  Jake took some risks with projects  leaps of faith  stepping up into starring roles in such studio disasters as "Tomcats" and "the First 20million is always the hardest"  Films hyped to glory among the Hollywood machine  which failed miserably  and left him needing to reassess his position . It was time for a break.some time away was needed.After a few-year hiatus from acting as he pursued directing films  "road-tripping" the country   and playing in his band around hollywood  he was ready for his come-back. Jake blasted onscreen as a pyrotechnic specialist in the final season of FX's hit series "Justified"  leaving many an audience member aghast  having thought he was a solid new addition to the show...alas  just a masterfully crafted cameo  blowing up in 30 seconds. When Robert Rodriguez cast him as the new Sex Machine for all three seasons of "From Dusk Till Dawn  Things started heating up again. In The History Channel mini-series "Texas Rising"  Busey plays Samuel Wallace  the man credited with reciting the legendary warning  "Remember the Alamo!" directed by Roland Joffe.His recent projects include "Mr. Robot"  and Stranger Things"  Showtime's "Ray Donovan"  CBS television's "NCIS" Episode 346(1516)   ABC's "Marvels agents of S.H.E.I.L.D..  Episode 513 & 519  and in the summer of 2018 he made his return to the summer tent-pole event scene with 20th Century Fox's "the_Predator".A bit of a modern-day Renaissance man  Jake's passions in life includes fatherhood  acting  desert racing  architecture  playing music  flying planes when necessary  and fabricating anything mechanical in his metal shop. .,1971-06-15,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,0,0

As a result  her career is flourishing again on both sides of the Pacific. Her two directing efforts were well-received critically  and in a 2008 interview she revealed she planned to direct again but was putting that off until her daughters were grown  since directing took her away from them too much  whereas acting could be done on a part-time basis.,1961-04-26,Shanghai  China,,,1,2

nm0001042,Lois Chiles,Lois Cleveland Chiles,171,Lois Chiles is a former supermodel-turned-actress who gave elegant performances in a variety of films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Her motion picture debut role was as Robert Redford's sexual endeavor in the old-fashioned Hollywood melodrama  Come eravamo (1973). Shortly after  she starred opposite Clifton Davis in the indie blaxploitation film  Together for Days (1973); they portrayed a mixed-race couple enduring societal disapproval and political pandemonium. She also appeared as the irreverent socialite Jordan Baker in Il grande Gatsby (1974)  in which she starred alongside Mia Farrow and  again  Robert Redford. Chiles delivered a series of pivotal characters particularly as a woman who mysteriously falls into a state of unconsciousness after entering the hospital for an early term abortion in Coma profondo (1978)  and as an impudent heiress and murder victim in the center of Assassinio sul Nilo (1978). Chiles' most recognized role is the sophisticated NASA astronaut  scientist  and "Bond girl"  Dr. Holly Goodhead opposite Roger Moore's James Bond in Moonraker - Operazione spazio (1979).

Sadly  that same year  just as Chiles' career was at its height  she lost her youngest brother to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which resulted in her three-year hiatus from acting. Her career never fully recovered and she struggled to find roles that necessitated her individuality but she persevered and received positive reviews for her continued performances in film and television  particularly in Sweet Liberty - La dolce indipendenza (1986)  Dentro la notizia (1987)  Creepshow 2 (1987)  Diario di un killer (1991) and Curdled - Una commedia pulp (1996).

nm0001082,Billy Crudup,William Gaither Crudup,174,Known as much for his rigorous career choices as for his talent and chiseled good looks  Billy Crudup has been straddling the line between serious actor and "it" leading man for several years.Crudup was born in 1968 in Manhasset  New York (a Long Island suburb)  the middle child in a family of three boys. He is the son of Georgann (Gaither) and Thomas Henry Crudup III  and the grandson of prominent attorney William Cotter "Billy" Gaither  Jr.Crudup was raised in Florida and Texas. His family frequently moved and always being the new kid meant Billy had to develop some way of gaining acceptance. Being the class clown was his ticket in. He found roles in school pageants and developed funny impersonations to entertain family and friends. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina (where he confirmed his interest in acting). Upon graduation  Crudup headed to NYC to live with his brother Tommy (who was at that time a publicist) and study at New York University  where he joined a theatre troupe called "the lab!" and did little plays and musicals - he even played "Schroeder" in the famed children's musical "You're A Good Man Charlie Brown!".He then went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the Tisch School of the Arts at NY in 1994. A year later  he'd already made a name for himself on Broadway  earning the Outer Critics Circle Outstanding Newcomer Award for his performance in Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia".Crudup's first big-screen acting gig was in the indie film Grind (1997)  which was shot in 1994  but ended up on the shelf for three years. In 1996  he landed another  more lucrative role  opposite Hollywood hotshots Brad Pitt and Jason Patric in the Barry Levinson drama  Sleepers (1996). He followed that up with a brief appearance in Woody Allen's Tutti dicono I Love You (1996) and a higher-profile turn as the rakish older brother in Innocenza infranta (1997).A self-described student of human nature  Crudup has said that he looks for characters wrestling with their mistakes. Rumor has it that he declined an audition for the lead in Titanic (1997) in order to seek out more challenging projects--like the "Steve Prefontaine" biopic Without Limits (1998). "Limits" showcased Crudup's ability to completely transform himself for a role (a quality that would help him skirt stardom while continuing to land substantive parts). In 2000  with three major films in release  Crudup's already bustling movie career reached a fever pitch. He first hit the festival circuit in Keith Gordon's Waking the Dead (2000)  the tale of an up-and-coming politician who is haunted by the death of his young wife. Next came the art-house favorite Jesus' Son (1999). Finally  he starred as the semi-fictional '70s rocker "Russell Hammond" in Cameron Crowe's much-lauded Quasi famosi (2000). In 2002  his production of "The Elephant Man" on Broadway closed after 65 performances  due to low ticket sales.Crudup lives in New York and returns regularly to the stage - in fact  it was during the 1996 Broadway run of "Bus Stop" that he began his romance with longtime girlfriend  Mary-Louise Parker. That romance ended in 2004  when Crudup left the then-pregnant Parker for his Stage Beauty (2004) co-star  Claire Danes. He seems to prefer quiet anonymity to the pomp and circumstance of the movie star lifestyle  but his ever-growing popularity guarantees that he won't be able to avoid the spotlight altogether.,1968-07-08,Manhasset  New York  USA,,,0,0

nm0001112,Andrew Davis,Andrew Davis,,Director/Producer/Writer) Andrew Davis is a filmmaker with a reputation for directing intelligent thrillers  most notably the Academy Award-nominated box-office hit Il fuggitivo (1993)  starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.

Davis garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director and a Directors Guild of America nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Direction. In reviewing "The Fugitive"  film critic Roger Ebert commended Davis  noting that he "transcends genre and shows an ability to marry action and artistry that deserves comparison with [Alfred Hitchcock]  David Lean and Carol Reed. He paints with bold  visual strokes."Davis is the son of parents who met in a repertory theater company in Chicago  where he was raised.

nm0001131,Patrick Dempsey,Patrick Galen Dempsey,179,Patrick Dempsey has lived two charming but separate lives on film and television. From an exuberant  somewhat awkward charmer in college comedy films of the late 1980s and early 1990s  he has morphed spectacularly into a dreamy  wavy-haired television hunk of the new-age millennium and this seductive new image has since spilled off into romantic lead roles back on the large screen as a slightly offbeat  self-effacing Prince Charming type.Patrick Galen Dempsey was born on January 13  1966 in Lewiston  Maine  to M. Amanda (Casson) and William Allen Dempsey. He is the youngest of three. His father  an insurance agent  and his mother  a school secretary  raised the children in Buckfield (Maine). His parents were both originally from Pennsylvania  and he has German  English  and Scottish ancestry ("Dempsey" was the surname of his step-grandfather). Patrick  who was diagnosed as dyslexic (he has to fully memorize his scripts)  attended St. Dominic Regional High School but dropped out before graduating.Always interested in entertainment  Patrick studied juggling and entered several competitions. Acting was also a natural for him and  at age 15  he earned the role of the rebellious son in a Maine production of "On Golden Pond". Two years later  he won a prime role as David  the gay teen  in the Harvey Fierstein play "Torch Song Trilogy"  spending several months touring the San Francisco area with the show. In between he  found supplementary gigs dancing and juggling. More opportunities came his way after winning the protagonist role of Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" that toured in 1984. Directed by the renowned comedy favorite Gene Saks  Dempsey started looking at the possibility of film work.He made his movie debut in the secondary part of a Catholic student in the 1960s-era school-age comedy Catholic Boys (1985) starring "Brat Pack" actor Andrew McCarthy. More silliness followed with Meatballs - Porcelloni in vacanza (1986) and a ripe turn in the socially aware television-movie Disneyland: Una decisione difficile (1986) in which he played an epileptic teen who sues his parents (Beau Bridges and Karen Valentine) in order to have risky brain surgery. Around the same time  he found himself in a television series entitled Fast Times (1986)  based on the ultimate school-age film Fuori di testa (1982)  which made a star out of Sean Penn. Inheriting the Robert Romanus cool guy role of con artist Mike Damone  expectations were far too big and the television series died a quick death.However  his movie career got on a faster track and he scored well co-starring with the worldly Beverly D'Angelo in the movie Il pomo di Adamo (1987)  as a young man who makes headlines pursuing older women. Life resembled art that same year when Patrick married actress and drama coach Rocky Parker  who played a bit part in the film. He was 21 and she was 48. By this time  his trademark cuteness and appeal started taking shape. The youthful 21-year old Patrick played a nerd role next in the very funny high school comedy Playboy in prova (1987) with Amanda Peterson. A movie favorite for many  Patrick had reached the peak of his early career popularity. He showed a more serious side in the World War II-era drama La luna spezzata (1988)  which presented a Cyrano de Bergerac-like storyline with Patrick as the Christian de Neuvillette counterpart  but then he went straight back to familiar territory with the college-themed comedies Some Girls (1988) with Jennifer Connelly  Seduttore a domicilio (1989)  and Innamorati pazzi (1989).Stretching more in the 1990s  Patrick co-starred on stage in a 1991 production of "The Subject Was Roses" (playing the Martin Sheen film role) as the World War II soldier readjusting to civilian life with his parents (Dana Ivey and "Frasier" co-star John Mahoney). Films included the cross-country comedy-drama Operazione Cadillac (1990)  the action thriller Run (1991)  L'impero del crimine (1991)  in which he made a stab at playing major Mafioso Meyer Lansky  La musica del cuore (1993) opposite "Brat Pack" femme Molly Ringwald  the title role in Bank Robber (1993)  and the Mark Twain family-geared Ava's Magical Adventure (1994)  co-directed by Patrick and wife Rocky. However  the couple divorced that same year. On television  Patrick played a young John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the miniseries J.F.K.: Reckless Youth (1993)  Pierre Arronax in the television remake of 20.000 leghe sotto i mari (1997)  and Raskolnikov in a small screen version of Delitto e castigo (1998). The rest of the decade on film was less newsworthy with co-starring or featured movie roles in Piscine - Incontri a Beverly Hills (1997)  Denial (1998)  There's No Fish Food in Heaven (1998) and Me and Will (1999).It was television that gave Patrick a shot in the arm as he progressed into the new millennium. A recurring role as Will's closeted sportscaster amour in the sitcom Will & Grace (1998) presented Patrick in a more mature  wry and sexier fashion. Another recurring role in Ancora una volta (1999) earned him a dramatic Emmy nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor  and a third on The Practice - Professione avvocati (1997) was also extremely well-received. While the romantic comedy film Tutta colpa dell'amore - Sweet home Alabama (2002) opposite Reese Witherspoon really nailed the direction Dempsey was headed  the medical series Grey's Anatomy (2005)  as neurosurgeon Dr. Derek Shepherd (aka "Dr. McDreamy")  gave distaff audiences the whole heartthrob package. The perfect vehicle to showcase his undeniable charisma and sharp talent for offbeat comedy  he is a two-time Golden Globe nominee and his popularity has absolutely skyrocketed. This reawakening has also swung the door open again on high-profile film offers  registering with the ladies once again in a number of light leading man parts  notably Come d'incanto (2007) and Un amore di testimone (2008).Off-camera  Dempsey married a second time in 1999  to make-up artist and Delux Beauty founder Jillian Dempsey. The couple have three children: daughter  Tallulah Fyfe (born 2002)  and twin sons Darby Galen and Sullivan Patrick (born 2007). An avid sports car racer (he has participated in the Indianapolis and Daytona Beach events)  he showed off a more humanitarian side when he started the Patrick Dempsey Center for Cancer Hope and Healing in his hometown of Lewiston after his mother developed ovarian cancer. Befittingly  he has produced a sexy men's fragrance line by Avon called "Unscripted".,1966-01-13,Lewiston  Maine  USA,,,1,3

nm0001167,Shelley Duvall,Shelley Alexis Duvall,173,Shelley Alexis Duvall was born in Fort Worth  Texas  the first child to Bobbie Ruth (Massengale  1929-2020)  a real estate broker  and Robert Richardson Duvall (1919-1994)  a lawyer. At the time of her birth  her mother was visiting her grandmother in Fort Worth  though Duvall was raised in Houston. During her childhood  Shelley's mother humorously gave Shelley the nickname "Manic Mouse"  because she would often run around her house and tip over furniture. Shelley however was more than a mouse  but rather quite the little artist. Her favorite thing to do when she was very young was draw. She also has three brothers: Scott  Shane  and Stewart.Shelley graduated from Waltrip High School in Texas and at first became a cosmetics salesperson. It was in 1970 when Shelley was discovered by talent scouts at a local party. Director Robert Altman wanted to cast Shelley in a film that he was making during the time. Shelley had experience in acting in high school plays at the time and took Altman's offer and she appeared in her first film Brewster McCloud. Altman was so fascinated by her performance that she appeared in his next films including: McCabe and Mrs. Miller in 1971  Thieves Like Us in 1974  and Nashville in 1975. Aside from these three successful films  Duvall's acting blossomed in her leading role as Mille Lammoroux in 3 Women in 1977. Duvall's acting was so superb that she won Best Actress at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. Shelley also starred as Bernice in Joan Micklin Silver's Bernice Bobs Her Hair in 1976  and had a cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall in 1977. In the same year  Shelley also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.When the 1980s hit  Duvall's career was just beginning. She is famously known for playing the role of "Wendy Torrance" in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with Jack Nicholson. During the making of this film  Kubrick and Duvall would often become very frustrated with each other. The most obvious example is when Kubrick shot the famous "baseball bat scene" with Duvall and Nicholson 127 times  which is the world record for most number of takes in any film set. Despite their differences  Duvall admitted that she learned more from Kubrick than any of her previous films and that she "wouldn't trade the experience for anything." Kubrick also knew that he pushed Shelley and treated her the way he did for a significant reason  as the role of "Wendy Torrance" was even said by Jack Nicholson  "the hardest role anyone has ever had to play."In January of 1979  Robert Altman would offer Duvall yet another role in one of his films. Only the role was a certain role that Altman believed she was born to play. That certain role was "Olive Oyl" in the real life version of Popeye. Shelley was skeptical at first on accepting the role  due to bad memories as a child of negatively being called "Olive Oyl" in grade school. She fortunately decided to take the role and performed admirably. Shelley also sings several songs in this film. The most famous ones would be "He's Large" and "He Needs Me" which also appeared in the film Punch Drunk Love.As the 1980s rolled on  Shelley's career never slowed down. She appeared as a supporting actress in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits in 1981; she played "Susan Frankenstein" in Tim Burton's Frankenweenie (1984)   and co-starred in the hit comedy film Roxanne in 1987 starring Steve Martin. From 1982 to 1986  Shelley continued her filming career but from a different aspect. Since Shelley was 17  she had a collection of a variety of illustrated classic fairy tale books. During the making of Popeye  she showed her collection to Robin Williams. One particular fairy tale she showed Robin was "The Frog Prince". Picturing Robin as the real life Frog Prince  Shelley created Platypus Productions  her own production company. Shelley went to Showtime with the idea for airing a television program that was based on fairy tales. She produced Fairy Tale Theater which Showtime aired that was a hit television series that was based on several classic fairy tales. Fairy Tale Theatre was on television from 1982-1987. Each episode was a one-hour series and there were a total of twenty six episodes  all hosted by Shelley Duvall. Shelley also starred in four out of the twenty six episodes. In 1985  Ms. Duvall created Tall Tales and Legends that was aired for three years until it ended in 1988. Similar to Fairy Tale Theatre  Tall Tales and Legends was also a one-hour series hosted  produced  and guest starred by Duvall. Although it only consisted of nine episodes  Shelley was nominated for an Emmy from the series. In the late 1980s and early 1990s  Shelley discovered Think Entertainment; another production company which helped Shelley create more programs and movies that were made for television that aired on common cable channels. Shelley produced three more programs from these production companies that aired on Showtime: Nightmare Classics  Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories  and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle. Her Bedtime Stories program earned her a 2nd Emmy Nomination. Shelley sold Think Entertainment in 1993 and retired as a producer.Shelley Duvall's later career found her a number of different roles. She appeared in the family comedy Home Fries in 1998 playing "Mrs. Jackson"  Drew Barrymore's character's mother. Other comedic films Shelley appeared in were Suburban Commando in 1991  and Changing Habits in 1997. She also had cameos in several TV series' such as: Frasier  L.A. Law  The Ray Bradbury Theater  Wishbone  and several others. Shelley returned to the horror genre when she played "Martha Stewart" in The 4th Floor in 1999 and played the role of "Mrs. Stein" in Big Monster On Campus in 2000; which consisted of both the comedy and horror genre.Since 2002  Shelley Duvall has not acted in any films  but lives a quiet and peaceful life in Blanco  Texas. She has lived in Blanco since 1994  after her home in Los Angeles got damaged by an earthquake. For the last couple years  there have been several rumors about Duvall being a "recluse" and not being in touch with reality. However  a recent interview in 2010 was conducted by MondoFilm VideoGuide that had heavy proof that Shelley is as normal and aware of reality as ever. She has also noted in this interview that she takes care of several animals at her home in Texas and writes a lot of poetry  and that returning to acting is always a possibility.,1949-07-07,Houston  Texas  USA,,,1,0
nm0001168,Bob Dylan,Robert Allen Zimmerman,171,Robert Allen Zimmerman was born 24 May 1941 in Duluth  Minnesota; his father Abe worked for the Standard Oil Co. Six years later the family moved to Hibbing  often the coldest place in the US  where he taught himself piano and guitar and formed several high school rock bands. In 1959 he entered the University of Minnesota and began performing as Bob Dylan at clubs in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The following year he went to New York  performed in Greenwich Village folk clubs  and spent much time in the hospital room of his hero Woody Guthrie. Late in 1961 Columbia signed him to a contract and the following year released his first album  containing two original songs. Next year "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" appeared  with all original songs including the 1960s anthem "Blowin' in the Wind." After several more important acoustic/folk albums  and tours with Joan Baez  he launched into a new electric/acoustic format with 1965's "Bringing It All Back Home" which  with The Byrds' cover of his "Mr Tambourine Man " launched folk-rock. The documentary Dont Look Back (1967) was filmed at this time; he broke off his relationship with Baez and by the end of the year had married Sara Dylan (born Sara Lowndes). Nearly killed in a motorcycle accident 29 July 1966  he withdrew for a time of introspection. After more hard rock performances  his next albums were mostly country. With his career wandering (and critics condemning the fact)  Sam Peckinpah asked him to compose the score for  and appear in  his Pat Garrett e Billy Kid (1973) - more memorable as a soundtrack than a film. In 1974 he and The Band went on tour  releasing his first #1 album  "Planet Waves". It was followed a year later by another first-place album  "Blood on the Tracks". After several Rolling Thunder tours  the unsuccessful film Renaldo e Clara (1978) and a divorce  he stunned the music world again by his release of the fundamentalist Christrian album "Slow Train Coming " a cut from which won him his first Grammy. Many tours and albums later  on the eve of a European tour May 1997  he was stricken with histoplasmosis (a possibly fatal infection of the heart sac); he recovered and appeared in Bologna that September at the request of the Pope. In December he received the Kennedy Center Award for artistic excellence.,1941-05-24,Duluth  Minnesota  USA,,,2,5

nm0001180,Britt Ekland,Britt-Marie Eklund,165,Britt Ekland was born in Sweden and grew up to be the poster girl for beautiful  big-eyed Scandinavian blondes. She attended a drama school and then joined a traveling theater group. With her looks as her passport  Britt entered films and became a star in Italy. When Peter Sellers met her in a hotel  he fell hard for her and they soon married. The combination of Sellers' stardom and her stunning beauty contributed to her fame (the fact that Sellers suffered a heart attack in bed on their wedding night did not hurt  either). She appeared in two films with her husband: Caccia alla volpe (1966)  written by Neil Simon  and the forgettable Il magnifico Bobo (1967). Her claim to fame would come as the young girl who invented the striptease in Quella notte inventarono lo spogliarello (1968). After that  she appeared in a string of movies that were built around her looks and not much else. She did appear in some first-rate productions over the years  though  two of them being Carter (1971) and the cult classic The Wicker Man (1973). The high point in her career would be her role as Bond girl Mary Goodnight in Agente 007 - L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro (1974). After her much publicized breakup with rocker Rod Stewart in 1977  Britt continued to make movies--both features and made-for-TV films--and tried the stage. By that time  the quality of her film projects had decreased markedly  and she was reduced to appearing in things like Dal college con furore (1985) and Beverly Hills Vamp (1989).,1942-10-06,Stockholm  Sweden,,,2,2

nm0001190,David Prowse,David Charles Prowse,198,David "Dave" Prowse was born into a working class family on July 1  1935 in Bristol  England  UK. He was raised by his mother and never knew his father. As a child  David was disadvantaged and a poor student  he found a passion for bodybuilding and weight training in his early teens  as a young adult  David often entered weightlifting competitions and contested in the famous Mr. Universe contest. Eventually  David won the British heavyweight weightlifting title and gained status as a highly regarded and respected member of the fitness community. Over this period of competitive weightlifting  David became lifelong friends with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno  who at the time were not professional actors but rival competitors. After appearing on various broadcast sporting events  David was offered a role in the feature film James Bond 007 - Casino Royale (1967) as "Frankenstein's Monster". Although the casting was based on David's stature  David developed a strong interest in acting and decided to pursue it further.From 1967 to 1977  David enjoyed a quiet  but very successful career within film and television starring in such films as Arancia meccanica (1971)  Up Pompeii (1971) and numerous Hammer House of Horror films  gaining a vast and bulky CV. In 1975  David's popularity as a respected fitness guru landed him with the role and duty of the Green Cross Code Man  a superhero designed by the British road safety committee to teach road safety to children. The persona saw David traveling the world to give talks  demonstrations and shoot short television spots based on the hero's message. Proving successful the Green Cross Code Man continued to be a side project throughout David's busy career until the 1990s. He considers this role to be of great importance  and has stated many times that it is possibly the most rewarding job he has held.It was not until 1977 when David attended an audition for a film entitled Star Wars. The film was not considered to be a big thing at the time and the audition was held by director George Lucas. At the meeting  George offered David either the part of Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Instantly turning away the role of Chewbacca  David insisted he play the lead villain Darth Vader. George asked David why he wanted to play Vader and he replied "Everyone remembers the villain  George." David also had a wealth of experience playing villains in previous films  and was the obvious choice. David played the role of Darth Vader for the entirety of the original Star Wars trilogy: Guerre stellari (1977)  L'Impero colpisce ancora (1980) and Il ritorno dello Jedi (1983). Although David does not voice the character  he is the physical body. Star Wars is perhaps David's most important role and a role that has enlisted him as one of the most memorable character villains of all time.There have been many rumors  disputes and discussions about David's relationship with Star Wars and its staff. Regarding the apparent misled information David received about Vader's voice  promotional neglect and general mistreatment from Lucasfilm. This feud resulted in David being banned from all official Star Wars events. A statement from George Lucas read "He has burnt too many bridges." David claims that a majority of the rumors in circulation regarding the topic are fabricated and false including those of respectable actors involved  and has openly admitted his support of James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader and claims Lucas film were too concerned with keeping Vader a character than letting David receive deserved credit. The topic is covered in detail  in David's autobiography "Straight from the Force's Mouth". After Star Wars  David continued to work in television and film  making numerous appearances with the legendary Benny Hill. He continued to tour as the Green Cross Code Man and became the personal fitness trainer of many celebrities including Daniel Day-Lewis and Vanessa Redgrave.David has been loyal to Star Wars fans and participated in a number of fan-films as various characters spoofing Star Wars. Towards the end of David's busy acting period  his health declined due to a serious inflammation of arthritis  leaving David unable to stand for long periods of time and inflicting agonizing pain on his knees and hips. Undergoing treatment with hip replacement operations  it was discovered that David had prostate cancer in 2009. After a series of radiotherapy treatments at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London  David made a full recovery in a remarkably short period of time. David was awarded Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2000 Queen's Millennium Honours List for his contributions to charity and spokesmanship for road safety  the disabled and other various charities. From 2004  David began writing his autobiography entitled "Straight from the Force's Mouth" which covers his career in showbiz and documents an unedited diary account of the Star Wars production. The book was published officially in hardback by Apex Publishing in 2011  in which David toured Europe to attend book signings and personal appearances.Over the course of his career  between acting and touring the world both as the Green Cross Code Man and David Prowse  David has trained actors for films including Christopher Reeve for Superman (1978)  written fitness books "Fitness is Fun"  supported charity and even became the head of fitness for superstore Harrods. David more recently spends his time attending unofficial Star Wars events  conventions and film events where he signs photos  speaks to the fans and is in high demand as a public speaker all over the world.,1935-07-01,Bristol  England  UK,,,0,3
nm0001193,Shelley Fabares,Michele Marie Fabares,163,Vibrant  increasingly lovely teen fave Shelley Fabares withstood the test of time by transitioning successfully into adult parts unlike many of her 1960s "teen queen" peers who faded quickly into the memory books. She was born Michele Marie Fabares on January 19  1944  in sunny Santa Monica  Californnia. As the niece of singer/comedienne Nanette Fabray  she was indoctrinated early into the show biz life. Tap dancing from age three  she also modeled during her elementary school and began appearing on such TV shows as Le avventure di Jet Jackson (1954) and Annie Oakley (1954) (the latter a recurring role). At age 12  she made her professional film debut in the Rock Hudson/Cornell Borchers tearjerker Come prima... meglio di prima (1956) as Hudson's daughter  and went on to play kid sister roles in the rock 'n' roll-themed Gli indiavolati (1956) and its sequel Summer Love (1957) both starring John Saxon.Teen-idol status came with her coming-of-age role as the ever-wholesome daughter "Mary Stone" on The Donna Reed Show (1958)  a part she played for five seasons before embarking on a more grown-up film career. During the run of the classic sitcom  she and TV "brother" Paul Petersen grew so popular that they sprinted to adjoining pop singing celebrity  although both admitted that their vocal talents were limited. Shelley especially enjoyed a #1 Billboard hit with the breathy  sultry-edged "Johnny Angel". The character of "Mary Stone" was gently phased out of the show as her character "left for college".By this time  Shelley had turned into quite a curvaceous stunner. Her acting mettle hardly tested  she managed to become part of the bikini-clad blonde set with top femme parts in such fun-and-frolic fare as Ride the Wild Surf (1964)  Hold On! (1966)  which was a vehicle for British singing sensation Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits  and three of Elvis Presley's less-acclaimed vehicles of the later 1960s: Pazzo per le donne (1965)  Voglio sposarle tutte (1966) and Miliardario... ma bagnino (1967).A serious Vietnam-era stream of consciousness began to pervade film audiences in the late 1960s and Shelley's perky innocence that found so much favor during the Camelot years had lost its appeal. After a notoriously dry spell  she bounced back as the altruistic wife of a dying footballer "Brian Piccolo" in La canzone di Brian (1971)  opposite James Caan  and settled comfortably again on the small screen with bright co-star roles on the series Il dottor Jamison (1972)  Buongiorno  dottor Bedford (1976)  and Highcliffe Manor (1979). A more prickly character than usual  however  reared its head in the late-night soap spoof Forever Fernwood (1977)  and this led to the equally malicious  vainglorious role of Bonnie Franklin's business competitor on the already-established hit sitcom Giorno per giorno (1975). The show also featured her aunt Nanette Fabray as Franklin's meddling mom. In the late 1980s  Shelley found a fleshier character as Craig T. Nelson's resourceful mate on Coach (1989)  earning steady work for eight seasons and two Emmy nominations in the process. A return to film stardom  however  would eclipse her.Married and separated from record producer Lou Adler during her fun-in-the-sun years of the mid 1960s (they eventually divorced in 1980 after a separation of almost 14 years)  Shelley found marital stability with actor/activist Mike Farrell of MASH (1972) fame  and became stepmother to his two children from a prior marriage. Following her recovery from a home accident that broke several ribs in 1998  Shelley was tested and diagnosed with severe auto-immune hepatitis  which resulted in a liver transplant in 2000. Thankfully  she survived the near-fatal ordeal and has been more heard than seen in recent years. She supplied the voice of "Martha Kent" on the Le avventure di Superman (1996) animated series but has done little else in the ensuing years.,1944-01-19,Santa Monica  California  USA,,,1,0

nm0001235,William Forsythe,William Forsythe,178,Dynamically entertaining heavyset US actor with piercing eyes  William Forsythe has a superb talent for playing some truly unlikable and downright nasty characters that dominate the films in which he appears! If you're cast as the hero against Forsythe's villain  then you have your work cut out for you  as Forsthye's raw energy and menace on screen is second to none. He started out in a couple of minor film roles and guest appearances in high-rated TV shows including Chips (1977)  Hill Street giorno e notte (1981) and T.J. Hooker (1982). He quickly moved into high-quality feature films  including playing a small-time hoodlum in C'era una volta in America (1984)  an hilariously funny performance as a bumbling jail escapee alongside John Goodman in the knockout Arizona Junior (1987) and as a renegade soldier in Ricercati: ufficialmente morti (1987).The energetic Forsythe portrayed comic book villain "Flattop" in Dick Tracy (1990)  was foolish enough to tangle with vengeful cop Steven Seagal in the hyper-violent Giustizia a tutti i costi (1991) and locked horns with ex-NFL linebacker Brian Bosworth in the biker action film Forza d'urto (1991). With his expertise in playing icy villains  Forsythe was perfect to portray Prohibition mobster Al Capone in the short-lived '90s revival of the classic '60s crime show  The Untouchables (1993)  and he continued the motif of playing edgy  nefarious individuals in the thought-provoking Vita di cristallo (1992)  the oily film noir piece Cosa fare a Denver quando sei morto (1995)  as real-life mobster Sammy Gravano  aka "The Bull"  in Gotti (1996) and supporting another ex-NFL player's foray into film acting  when L.A. Raider Howie Long debuted in Tempesta di fuoco (1998).Forsythe has remained perpetually busy in the new century with a plethora of feature film  telemovie and TV series appearances  and has developed a minor cult following amongst film fans for his attention grabbing dramatic skills - check out his performances in Colpevole d'omicidio (2002)  La casa del diavolo (2005) and Halloween - The Beginning (2007).,1955-06-07,Bedford-Stuyvesant  Brooklyn  New York City  New York  USA,,,1,3

nm0001249,Monique Gabrielle,Katherine Gonzalez,168,Beautiful  buxom and shapely knockout Monique Gabrielle added an ample  alluring and invigorating dose of smoldering sex appeal to a bunch of enjoyably down'n'dirty horror and exploitation pictures made throughout the 80s and 90s. The 5' 6" natural brunette was born as Katherine Gonzalez on July 30th  1963 in Kansas City  Missouri and was raised in Denver  Colorado.

She had small roles in the mainstream features "Airplane II: The Sequel " "Night Shift " "Young Doctors in Love " "Flashdance " "Hard to Hold " and "Fear of a Black Hat." Gabrielle achieved her greatest enduring popularity as the enticing young woman who tries to seduce Tom Hanks in the uproariously raucous'n'raunchy "Bachelor Party." Her most memorable roles include a pathetic junkie snitch in the terrifically trashy babes-behind-bars classic "Chained Heat " the titular brazen and uninhibited sexual adventuress in the steamy "Emmanuelle V " a sweet princess and her evil twin in "Deathstalker II " a nude model in the funny sketch comedy "Amazon Women on the Moon " a gutsy lady cop in "Silk 2 " feisty security chief Miss Poinsettia in the amusingly campy "The Return of Swamp Thing " and the nerdy  repressed Megan in the delightfully dippy "Evil Toons."Gabrielle did guest spots on the TV shows "Dream On " "Hardball " and "Hunter."

nm0001252,Vincent Gallo,Vincent Gallo,180,Vincent Gallo. American-born  Buffalo  New York  1961. Left home  moved to New York City in 1978  and began playing in the experimental musical group  Gray  with artist Jean Michel Basquiat. After leaving Gray  he formed the band  Bohack  and recorded the highly regarded avant-garde industrial noise album  "It Took Several Wives".During the same period  Gallo also became known in New York City for his very unusual street performances  which were spontaneously executed in public and also witnessed by invited guests in the know. The One-Armed Man  The Man with No Face  Sandman  Boy Hit by a Car  and Boy Cries in Restaurant Window  to name a few. These radical public performances were upsetting and disturbing and were meant to provoke thought  self-reflection and consciousness. Gallo's invited guests could witness his performance's impact in this larger public context.One invited guest  New York Underground filmmaker  Eric Mitchell  cast Gallo as the lead in his film  The Way It Is (1985)  alongside newcomer Steve Buscemi. The Way It Is (1985) was Gallo's first appearance in a feature-length film  though previously he had directed himself in several short films  including If You Feel Froggy  Jump (1980)  The Gunlover (1986) and Rocky 10  as well as the collaborations with filmmaker Michael Holman  Vincent Gallo as "Jesus Christ" (used in Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996)) and Vampire LeStat.Since his early performance art days  Gallo has continued to create very conceptual performance pieces. Examples are a series of protesting of protests. Gallo has also created his own website  which upon closer examination  is actually a highly conceptual artwork resonating with his early performance work.On his website www.vincentgallo.com in the merchandise section  Gallo is selling his sperm and sexual fantasies as conceptual works. Gallo's Internet art questions celebrity  procreation  ego  social agenda  and views of religion  race and sexuality. These public offerings are motivated by extreme sensitivity  concept and thoughtfulness  however their presentation appears crude and offensive. Misinterpretation of this work is common and Gallo is often incorrectly categorized as a racist  sexist  homophobe. Gallo has had over 25 one-man shows of his paintings  including several with famed New York art dealer  Annina Nosei  and 4 museum shows including one at the Hara Museum in Tokyo  Japan.Gallo has also released several musical albums including 2 on the prestigious Warp Records label-When and Recordings of Music for Film. Gallo wrote  composed and performed the original music for the films Buffalo '66 (1998)  The Agent (1990) and Promises Written in Water (2010).In the 1980s  Gallo reached the professional level of Grand Prix motorcycle racing  though he did not win a national championship. Gallo is one of the actual motorcycle riders in his feature film  The Brown Bunny (2003).For many years  Gallo has been known and highly respected in hi-fi and music recording circles and is considered by many professionals in the field as having world-class knowledge and experience. He has been published many times by specialty magazines focused on high fidelity designs and equipment as well as music recording techniques and equipment. His collection of vintage hi-fi and recording gear  as well as musical instruments  is amongst the largest and most refined in the world. Gallo is also a fanatic record collector  owning over 35 000 vinyl LP's.Gallo has no agent  manager  assistant or intern and he makes his films without producers  and with extremely scaled down crews. He has self-distributed his movies and is directly involved in his films' sales for distribution. Gallo has also created all of his films' trailers and posters.Gallo is one of the most misunderstood  misquoted  misrepresented talents in the past 25 years and a brief review of his IMDb page suggests he has also been incredibly prolific.,1961-04-11,Buffalo  New York  USA,,,0,0

nm0001275,Philip Glass,Philip Morris Glass,174,Born in Baltimore  Maryland  Glass worked in his father's radio store and discovered music listening to the offbeat Western classical records customers didn't seem to want. He studied the violin and flute  and obtained early admission to the University of Chicago. After graduating in mathematics and philosophy  he went to New York's Juilliard school  drove a cab  and studied composition with Darius Milhaud and others.At 23  he moved to Paris to study under the legendary Nadia Boulanger  who taught almost all of the major Western classical composers of the 20th century. While there  he discovered Indian classical music while transcribing the works of Ravi Shankar into Western musical notation for a French filmmaker. A creative turning point  Glass researched non-Western music in India and parts of Africa  and applied the techniques to his own composition.Back in the United States  Glass spent the late 1960s and early 1970s driving a taxi cab in New York and creating a major collection of new music. In 1976  his landmark opera "Einstein on the Beach" was staged by Robert Wilson to a baffling variety of reviews. His compositions were so avant-garde that he had to form the Philip Glass Ensemble to give them a venue for performance. Although called a minimalist by the Western classical mainstream  he denies this categorization. His major works include opera  theater pieces  dance  and song.His work in film  beginning with Koyaanisqatsi (1982)  gave filmmakers such as Godfrey Reggio and Errol Morris a new venue of expression through the documentary form. His many recordings have also widened his audience. He was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera to compose "The Voyage" for the Columbus quinquacentennial in 1992. In 1996  he composed original music for the Atlanta Olympic Games  which  perhaps  made Glass almost mainstream. Glass remains one of the most important American composers. His music is distinctive  haunting  and evocative. Either performed by itself or in collaboration with other media  his compositions move the listener to unexplored places. More recently  a major reexamination of Glass's oeuvre has led him to be labeled the Last Romantic by the musical press.,1937-01-31,Baltimore  Maryland  USA,,,1,4

nm0001297,Joel Grey,Joel David Katz,165,Joel Grey's father  Mickey Katz  created "Borscht Capades" in the early 1950s. Mickey Katz was a musician -- a clarinetist and a saxophone player -- in bands around the east. Mickey was performing  playing in a band in Cleveland  Ohio  which is where Joel Grey was born. Musician and bandleader Spike Jones needed a clarinet player who could do bits  funny things. Mickey went on the road with Jones' band for about a year  the Katz family ending up  as the band all went to California.One day his father Mickey was doing a recording session at the Sunset Boulevard RCA-Victor recording studio in Hollywood  and during a break  Mickey always wrote parodies to pop songs for fun and had just written this parody -- he was singing it to one of the other Jewish musicians. Unbeknownst to him the microphone was open in the control room and this group of non-Jewish  white-bread heads of RCA-Victor were sitting there and he's singing a Yiddish song. They didn't know what he was singing but they were laughing and laughing and they decided to record it. The recording became an enormous hit. The records were so successful Mickey put together a variety show that sold out every week in Los Angels at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Joel knew  even at 9  that he was going to become an actor. When his father had this variety show  Joel said  "How can I be in it?" And his father said  "Well  what do you want to do?" Joel replied  "I don't know how to sing and I don't dance  but I'll run around and I'll move."So Joel's aunt dropped him a song that was a big record in New York  a Yiddish song -- it was a million words and very fast and it was very popular with the audience -- and Joel learned it by rote. Joel had no idea what he was saying or singing and the next thing he knew  he was boxed in to being a song-and-dance man as opposed to an actor. "Romania  Romania." The song was like a Danny Kaye spectacular  fast  patter song that left a lot of room to dance and sing and mug and do all the things like his hero at the time -- Jerry Lewis. Maybe two years  Eddie Cantor saw Joel in Florida and put him on his "Colgate Comedy Hour' television show  and that was the end of the "Borscht Capades" for Joel  and the beginning of Joel's long tenure in night clubs all over the country.,1932-04-11,Cleveland  Ohio  USA,,,1,2

He is of German (from his paternal grandfather)  English  and Irish descent. The acting bug first hit when David was seven and so he took acting  singing and dancing lessons. He was very shy off stage in front of girls because he was tall and thin  but when he was on stage he was in his element. Due to his father's work  his family (he has four sisters) moved around frequently. He initially thought his career was going to go in the direction of musicals and Broadway.American audiences first came to know Hasselhoff when he portrayed the popular "Dr. Snapper Foster" for six seasons on CBS's soap opera  Febbre d'amore (1973).

nm0001335,Tippi Hedren,Nathalie Kay Hedren,163,Tippi Hedren was born Nathalie Kay Hedren in New Ulm  Minnesota  to Dorothea Henrietta (Eckhardt) and Bernard Carl Hedren  who ran a general store. Her father was of Swedish descent and her mother was of German and Norwegian ancestry. Tippi was working as a New York fashion model when she married her first husband  4-years-younger Peter Griffith  in 1952 (married until 1961). She gave birth to her only child  Melanie Griffith  on August 9  1957. Alfred Hitchcock discovered Tippi  the pretty cover girl  while viewing a 1962 TV commercial on NBC's Today (1952). He put her under personal contract and cast her in Gli uccelli (1963). In a cover article about the movie in Look magazine (Dec. 4  1962)  Hitchcock praised her; he also told the Associated Press: "Tippi Hedren is really remarkable. She's already reaching the lows and highs of terror". The film earned her both the Golden Globe and Photoplay awards for Most Promising Newcomer. She fulfilled that promise in Hitchcock's next film Marnie (1964)  giving the performance of her life as a frigid  habitual thief blackmailed into marrying her boss (Sean Connery). The professional relationship with Hitchcock ended with mutual bitterness and disappointment during shooting. That year  she married her agent  Noel Marshall (married until 1982). Charles Chaplin cast her in a small role in his final film La contessa di Hong Kong (1967)  which flopped. Thereafter  Tippi and her husband Marshall collected big cats and other wildlife for the film Il grande ruggito (1981)  which they starred in and produced. The film took 11 years and $17 million to make  but it only made $2 million worldwide. Nevertheless  the film was a turning point in her life; she became actively involved in animal rights  as well as a wide variety of humanitarian and environmental causes. She married her third husband  businessman Luis Barrenecha  in 1985 but divorced him 10 years later. In 2002  she became engaged to veterinarian Martin Dinnes  but they called it off after 6 years and no wedding. Tippi has devoted much time and effort to charitable causes: she is a volunteer International Relief Coordinator for "Food for the Hungry". She has traveled worldwide to set up relief programs following earthquakes  hurricanes  famine and war  and has received numerous awards for her efforts  including the Humanitarian Award presented to her by the Baha'i Faith. As for animal causes  she is founder and president of The Roar Foundation. Onscreen  she continues to work frequently in films  theater and TV. She appeared in I Woke Up Early the Day I Died (1998)  finally bringing to the big screen the last screenplay written by the late Edward D. Wood Jr. in 1974 (and featuring Wood regulars Maila Nurmi and Conrad Brooks  just about the only surviving members of Wood's stock company). She also enjoyed playing comedic roles  such as an abortion rights activist in Alexander Payne's satire La storia di Ruth - Donna americana (1996) and slapping Jude Law in I Heart Huckabees - Le strane coincidenze della vita (2004). Tippi's contributions to world cinema have been honored with Life Achievement awards in France at The Beauvais Film Festival Cinemalia 1994; in Spain  by The Fundacion Municipal De Cine in 1995; and at the Riverside International Film Festival in 2007. In 1999  Tippi was honored as "Woman of Vision" by Women in Film and Video in Washington  D.C.  and received the Presidential Medal for her work in film from Hofstra University.

nm0001368,Ernie Hudson,Earnest Lee Hudson,183,As a child growing up in Benton Harbor  Michigan  Ernie Hudson wrote short stories  poems and songs  always thinking that his words might one day come to life on stage. After a short stint in the Marine Corps  he moved to Detroit where he became the resident playwright at Concept East  the oldest black theatre in the country. In addition  he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors' Emsemble Theatre  where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State  he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school's repertory company  he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III's musical "Daddy Goodness " which led to his meeting Gordon Parks  who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film  Io  re del blues (1976). Unfortunately  all that followed "Leadbelly" was a year of "bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood " which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience  he learned another vital lesson: "There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it." Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation  Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round's production of "The Great White Hope " a role that he put "everything he had into " including shaving his head.

nm0001378,Anjelica Huston,Anjelica Huston,178,Anjelica Huston was born on July 8  1951 in Santa Monica  California  to prima ballerina Enrica "Ricki" (Soma) and director and actor John Huston. Her mother  who was from New York  was of Italian descent  and her father had English  Scottish  and Scots-Irish ancestry. Huston spent most of her childhood overseas  in Ireland and England  and in 1969 first dipped her toe into the acting profession  taking a few small roles in her father's movies. However  in that year her mother died in a car accident  at 39  and Huston relocated to the United States  where the tall  exotically beautiful young woman modeled for several years.While modeling  Huston had a few more small film roles  but decided to focus more on movies in the early 1980s. She prepared herself by reaching out to acting coach Peggy Feury and began to get roles. The first notable part was in Bob Rafelson's remake of the classic noir movie Il postino suona sempre due volte (1981) (in which Jack Nicholson  with whom Huston was living at the time  was the star). After a few more years of on-again  off-again supporting work  her father perfectly cast her as calculating  imperious Maerose  the daughter of a Mafia don whose love is scorned by a hit man (Nicholson again) in his film adaptation of Richard Condon's Mafia-satire novel L'onore dei Prizzi (1985). Huston won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance  making her the first person in Academy Award history to win an Oscar when a parent and a grandparent (her father and grandfather Walter Huston) had also won one.Huston thereafter worked prolifically  including notable roles in Francis Ford Coppola's Giardini di pietra (1987)  Barry Sonnenfeld's film versions of the Charles Addams cartoons La famiglia Addams (1991) and La famiglia Addams 2 (1993)  in which she portrayed Addams matriarch Morticia  Wes Anderson's I Tenenbaum (2001) and Le avventure acquatiche di Steve Zissou (2004). Probably her finest performance on-screen  however  was as Lilly  the veteran  iron-willed con artist in Stephen Frears' Rischiose abitudini (1990)  for which she received another Oscar nomination  this time for Best Actress. A sentimental favorite is her performance as the lead in her father's final film  an adaptation of James Joyce's The Dead - Gente di Dublino (1987) -- with her many years of residence in Ireland  Huston's Irish accent in the film is authentic.Endowed with her father's great height and personal boldness  and her mother's beauty and aristocratic nose  Huston certainly cuts an imposing figure  and brings great confidence and authority to her performances. She clearly takes her craft seriously and has come into her own as a strong actress  emerging from under the shadow of her father  who passed away in 1987. Huston married the sculptor Robert Graham in 1992. The couple lived in the Los Angeles area before Graham's death in 2008.,1951-07-08,Santa Monica  California  USA,,,0,0

She made her off-Broadway debut at the age of 17 and  from that moment to date  she received critical acclaim  appearing in such plays as: "Heartbreak House" (1983)  "The Road to Mecca" (1988)  "Broken Glass" (1994)  "The Three Sisters" (1997)  "The Guys" (2002)  "Ghosts" (2002) and "Celadine" (2004)  among others.In 1976  Amy made her film debut  playing "Sue Snell"  one of her most unforgettable characters in Stephen King's Carrie - Lo sguardo di Satana (1976)  a classic in the horror genre  taken to the big screen by director Brian De Palma. For the next few years  Irving continued working in important films  Fury (1978)  also directed by De Palma  Voices (1979) and Competition (1980). Later  in 1983  she gave a fine performance as "Hadass"  in Barbra Streisand's Yentl (1983)  and won an Oscar nomination for her great work in that successful film. Two of her best opportunities arrived in the late 80s  when she played "Anna Anderson" in Anastasia - L'ultima dei Romanov (1986) and "Isabelle Grossman" in the romantic comedy  Dall'altro lato della strada (1988); she received a Golden Globe nomination for each movie.Amy was married to director Steven Spielberg from 1985 to 1989 and she has a son with him  Max Spielberg. And  in 1990  after her divorce  she met Brazilian director Bruno Barreto while they were working on Prova di forza (1990). They wed a few years later and they have a son (Gabriel). In 1997  Irving made a guest appearance on Woody Allen's Harry a pezzi (1997) and  in 1999  she came back in the sequel of Carrie - Lo sguardo di Satana (1976)  Carrie 2: La furia (1999).Unfortunately  her film opportunities were supposedly narrowed in the 90s. However  in the year 2000  she surprised the whole world again when she performed as "Mary Ann Simpson"  a very funny and sensual  at the same time  English teacher in the film  Bossa Nova (2000). She managed to capture this peculiar character very well. After this romantic comedy  Amy had a great opportunity  playing "Barbara Wakefield"  Michael Douglas' wife in Traffic (2000)  the film was a huge success and she won an Actor Award  shared with the rest of the cast. Then  this beautiful and talented actress continued working in remarkable films such as 13 variazioni sul tema (2001)  with her Carrie - Lo sguardo di Satana (1976) co-star  Sissy Spacek  in the Walt Disney production  Tuck everlasting: Vivere per sempre (2002) and in the horror film  Nascosto nel buio (2005)  along with Robert De Niro. Recently  she had an important part as "Emily Sloane" in the very-known show  Alias (2001).In addition to her talents as an actress  she is a great dancer and also showed off her vocal talents  singing in films such as Chi ha incastrato Roger Rabbit (1988)  Accordi sul palcoscenico (1980)  Il potere magico - Tremotino (1987) and Fievel conquista il West (1991).Nowadays  Amy Irving continues working on stage in Broadway productions and spends most of her time with her friends and family  especially with her two children.,1953-09-10,Palo Alto  California  USA,,,2,2

nm0001392,Peter Jackson,Peter Jackson,165,Peter Jackson was born as an only child in a small coast-side town in New Zealand in 1961. When a friend of his parents bought him a super 8 movie camera (because she saw how much he enjoyed taking photos)  the then eight-year-old Peter instantly grabbed the thing to start recording his own movies  which he made with his friends. They were usually short  but they already had the trademark that would make Jackson famous: impressive special effects  made at a very low cost. For example  for his film "World War Two" which he made as a teenager  he used to simulate a firing gun by punching little holes into the celluloid  so that  once projected  the gun gave the impression of displaying a small fire. Jackson's first step towards more serious film-making came with an entry in a local contest to stimulate amateur and children's films. For this film  he used stop-motion animation to create a monster that ruins a city in the style of Ray Harryhausen. Unfortunately  he didn't win. At twenty-two  he embarked on a movie-making adventure that would change his life. This film  Fuori di testa (1987)  was begun as any other Jackson film  in an amateur style  at a low budget and using friends and local people to star in his film. Jackson himself did nearly everything in the movie; he directed  produced  filmed and starred in it  in a number of roles  amongst them that of the hero  "Derek". And everything was filmed on a second-hand  $250 camera. It took Jackson and his friends four years to complete the movie. What had started as a joke in a group of friends  then became a cult classic. A friend of Jackson who was working in the movie industry convinced him the film had commercial prospects and arranged for it to be shown at the Cannes film festival  where it won a lot of acclaim  as well as a number of prizes. The movie soon became a hit because of its bizarre humor and overdose of special effects  some realistic  some comedically amateur. After the success of Fuori di testa (1987)  Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies  after the success of his first professionally made movie  Splatters - Gli schizzacervelli (1992).,1961-10-31,Pukerua Bay  North Island  New Zealand,,,0,2
nm0001394,Derek Jacobi,Derek George Jacobi,178,Preeminent British classical actor of the first post-Olivier generation  Derek Jacobi was knighted in 1994 for his services to the theatre  and  in fact  is only the second to enjoy the honor of holding TWO knighthoods  Danish and English (Olivier was the other). Modest and unassuming in nature  Jacobi's firm place in theatre history centers around his fearless display of his characters' more unappealing aspects  their great flaws  eccentricities and  more often than not  their primal torment.Jacobi was born in Leytonstone  London  England  the only child of Alfred George Jacobi  a department store manager  and Daisy Gertrude (Masters) Jacobi  a secretary. His paternal great-grandfather was German (from Hoxter  Germany). His interest in drama began while quite young. He made his debut at age six in the local library drama group production of "The Prince and the Swineherd" in which he appeared as both the title characters. In his teens he attended Leyton County High School and eventually joined the school's drama club ("The Players of Leyton").Derek portrayed Hamlet at the English National Youth Theatre prior to receiving his high school diploma  and earned a scholarship to the University of Cambridge  where he initially studied history before focusing completely on the stage. A standout role as Edward II at Cambridge led to an invite by the Birmingham Repertory in 1960 following college graduation. He made an immediate impression wherein his Henry VIII (both in 1960) just happened to catch the interest of Olivier himself  who took him the talented actor under his wing. Derek became one of the eight founding members of Olivier's National Theatre Company and gradually rose in stature with performances in "The Royal Hunt of the Sun " "Othello" (as Cassio) and in "Hay Fever"  among others. He also made appearances at the Chichester Festival and the Old Vic.It was Olivier who provided Derek his film debut  recreating his stage role of Cassio in Olivier's acclaimed cinematic version of Otello (1965). Olivier subsequently cast Derek in his own filmed presentation of Chekhov's Three Sisters (1970). On TV Derek was in celebrated company playing Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1967) alongside Maggie Smith and then-husband Robert Stephens; Derek had played the role earlier at the Chichester Festival in 1965. After eight eventful years at the National Theatre  which included such sterling roles as Touchstone in "As You Like It"  Jacobi left the company in 1971 in order to attract other mediums. He continued his dominance on stage as Ivanov  Richard III  Pericles and Orestes (in "Electra")  but his huge breakthrough would occur on TV. Coming into his own with quality support work in Man of Straw (1972)  The Strauss Family (1972) and especially the series The Pallisers (1974) in which he played the ineffectual Lord Fawn  Derek's magnificence was presented front and center in the epic BBC series Claudius (1976). His stammering  weak-minded Emperor Claudius was considered a work of genius and won  among other honors  the BAFTA award.Although he was accomplished in Il giorno dello sciacallo (1973) and Dossier Odessa (1974)  films would place a distant third throughout his career. Stage and TV  however  would continue to illustrate his classical icon status. Derek took his Hamlet on a successful world tour throughout England  Egypt  Sweden  Australia  Japan and China; in some of the afore-mentioned countries he was the first actor to perform the role in English. TV audiences relished his performances as King Richard the Second (1978) and  of course Hamlet  Prince of Denmark (1980).After making his Broadway bow in "The Suicide" in 1980  Derek suffered from an alarming two-year spell of stage fright. He returned  however  and toured as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company (1982-1985) with award-winning results. During this period he collected Broadway's Tony Award for his Benedick in "Much Ado about Nothing"; earned the coveted Olivier  Drama League and Helen Hayes awards for his Cyrano de Bergerac; and earned equal acclaim for his Prospero in "The Tempest" and Peer Gynt. In 1986  he finally made his West End debut in "Breaking the Code" for which he won another Helen Hayes trophy; the play was then brought to Broadway.For the rest of the 80s and 90s  he laid stage claim to such historical figures as Lord Byron  Edmund Kean and Thomas Becket. On TV he found resounding success (and an Emmy nomination) as Adolf Hitler in I diari del terzo reich (1982)  and finally took home the coveted Emmy opposite Anthony Hopkins in the WWII drama Il decimo uomo (1988). He won a second Emmy in an unlikely fashion by spoofing his classical prowess on an episode of "Frasier" (his first guest performance on American TV)  in which he played the unsubtle and resoundingly bad Shakespearean actor Jackson Hedley.Kenneth Branagh was greatly influenced by mentor Jacobi and their own association would include Branagh's films Enrico V (1989)  L'altro delitto (1991)  and Hamlet (1996)  the latter playing Claudius to Branagh's Great Dane. Derek also directed Branagh in the actor's Renaissance Theatre Company's production of "Hamlet". In the 1990s Derek returned to the Chichester Festival  this time as artistic director  and made a fine showing in the title role of Uncle Vanya (1996).More heralded work of late include profound portrayals of the anguished titular painter in Love Is the Devil (1998)  the role of Gracchus in the popular  Oscar-winning film Il gladiatore (2000)  and sterling performances in such films as Two Men Went to War (2002)  Bye Bye Blackbird (2005)  The Riddle (2007)  Endgame (2009)  Il discorso del re (2010)  Jail Caesar (2012)  and as the King in Cenerentola (2015). Continuing to mesmerize on the stage  he has turned in superb performances in "Uncle Vanya" (2000)  Friedrich Schiller's "Don Carlos" (2005)  _A Voyage 'Round My Father (2006)  "Twelfth Night" (2009) and the title role in "King Lear" (2010). On the British TV series front  he has commanded more recent attention in the title role of a crusading monk in the mystery series I misteri dell'abbazia (1994)  as Lord Pirrie in Titanic - Nascita di una leggenda (2012)  as Alan in Last Tango in Halifax (2012)  and as Stuart Bixby in Vicious (2013).He and his life-time companion of three decades  Richard Clifford  filed as domestic partners in England in 2006. Clifford  a fine classical actor and producer in his own right  has shared movie time with Jacobi in Little Dorrit (1987)  Enrico V (1989)  and the TV version of Cyrano de Bergerac (1985).,1938-10-22,Leytonstone  London  England  UK,,,0,0
nm0001396,Mick Jagger,Michael Phillip Jagger,178,Michael Philip Jagger was born in Dartford  Kent on 26th July 1943. When he was 4 he met Keith Richards until they went into secondary schools and lost touch. But one day in 1960 they accidentally met on the Dartford train line and both realized that they had an interest in rock n roll combined with blues. Between 1960 and 1962 The Rolling Stones formed. It was comprised of Mick on lead vocal and harmonica  Keith Richards on guitar  Bill Wyman on bass  Charlie Watts on drums and Brian Jones on guitar.In 1964 they released their first album "The Rolling Stones". Eventually in 1965 they had their first number 1 hit in the UK with "The Last Time" which was followed by "I can't get no Satisfaction". Throughout 1966-1969 they toured the world with many great hits like "Let's Spend the night together" (1967) and "Sympathy for the Devil" (1968). But in 1969 Brian Jones committed suicide and Mick and Keith Richards were blamed for his death. But this fusion blew over and they got another guitarist to replace Brian in Mick Taylor. They released the album "Let it Bleed" (1969) with the track "Honky Tonk Woman". After they completed a North American tour Jagger finally went to star in Sadismo (1970) as the retired rock star Turner. The film was released in August 1970 with Mick starring opposite James Fox and Mick even had his first solo hit which was the soundtrack to the film "Memo from Turner".In 1971 The Rolling Stones came back with the album "Sticky Fingers" which would be the most popular album they ever made. From this album there were songs like "Wild Horses" and "Brown Sugar" and were major hits all over the world. While this was happening Bianca Jagger gave birth to Jaggers daughter Jade Jagger. Throughout the 70s The Rolling Stones made thousands of live performances and achieved endless record sales with hits like "Angie" (1973)  "It's Only Rock and Roll" (1974)  "Hot Stuff" (1976) and "Respectable" (1978). In 1974 Ronnie Wood had replaced Mick Taylor on guitar and Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood both played lead guitar. In 1980 Jagger divorced Bianca Jagger and went on to record and release "Emotional Rescue" with The Rolling Stones and it was a platinum album. In 1981 "Tattoo You" was released and the group went on a major world tour  their first in three years  which filled stadiums in the US and arenas in Europe. After the tour ended in 1982 Jagger was starting to like other music. In 1983 The Rolling Stones recorded the album "Undercover" at the Compass Point in Nassau. But recording sessions didn't go well as during this time Mick and Keith Richard were having arguments about the kind of music the group should be playing. Even though the album was a success it seemed like The Rolling Stones were now going over the edge.In May 1984 Mick recorded "State of Shock" with The Jacksons which led Mick wanting to try out a solo career. So in September he recorded his first solo album with guests like Pete Townshend and Jeff Beck. Shortly before the album was released The Rolling Stones decided to record their first album under a new Sony records contract. Keith Richards didn't approve of the solo efforts - he wanted Mick to stick to The Rolling Stones. In July 1985 Jagger made his first solo live appearance at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia. The Rolling Stones were going to perform but decided not to as things weren't going well for them at the time. During 1986 Mick worked on his second solo album "Primitive Cool" which he hoped would be a success but this was not to be. However  his 1988 tour proved to be a success  selling out in Japan.But Mick accepted the fact that the only way to carry on with success was to get back with The Rolling Stones so in January 1989 he and Keith Richards reformed and they wrote songs for what was to be the "Steel Wheels" album. After the album was released The Rolling Stones went on a major worldwide tour with special concerts at London's Wembley Stadium. Sadly though in 1992 bassist of The Rolling Stones Bill Wyman announced his departure from the group which was to be the following year. Even though The Rolling Stones were upset to see him leave they accepted the fact that he'd been in there too long and they had to let go. Jagger released some more solo material during this time but it wasn't such a success. In 1994 The Rolling Stones released the album "Voodoo Lounge" and they went back on tour. The first The Rolling Stones project without Bill Wyman. The tour was the biggest tour in rock history raising over 300 million. As this tour was a success they returned yet again in 1997 with the "Bridges to Babylon" album and tour which lasted for two years which was combined with the "No Security" live album and tour. After the tour was finished Jagger's marriage was on the line as he had another child from a secret love affair. Soon after this was found out the marriage between him and Jerry Hall had ended. Since then Jagger's been a film producer and a solo artist. He has produced the film Enigma (2001) and has recorded his 2001 album "Goddess in the Doorway" - another commercial flop. But never fear because just recently the Stones announced a 40th Anniversary tour and that it will start in September  2002.,1943-07-26,Dartford  Kent  England  UK,,,1,5

nm0001475,John Lithgow,John Arthur Lithgow,193,If "born to the theater" has meaning in determining a person's life path  then John Lithgow is a prime example of this truth.

Butterfly". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion  and in the mid 1970s  he and his wife divorced.

A second Oscar nomination followed for Voglia di tenerezza (1983)  and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife.

nm0001492,Kyle MacLachlan,Kyle Merritt McLachlan,183,The "boy next door  if that boy spent lots of time alone in the basement"  is how Rich Cohen described Kyle MacLachlan in a 1994 article for "Rolling Stone" magazine. That distinctly askew wholesomeness made MacLachlan a natural to become famous as the alter ego of twisted director David Lynch.MacLachlan was born and raised in Yakima  Washington  to Catherine Louise (Stone)  a public relations director  and Kent Alan McLachlan  a lawyer and stockbroker. He has Scottish  English  Cornish  and German ancestry. MacLachlan graduated from the University of Washington in 1982. The darkly handsome actor made his feature film debut when he starred in the big-budget David Lynch adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune (1984)  but only enjoyed real success after appearing in a second Lynch project  the moody and perverse classic  Velluto blu (1986).The following year saw MacLachlan appearing as an otherworldly FBI agent in the cult classic sci-fi film  L'alieno (1987). This turned out to be a sign of things to come  as MacLachlan soon took on another oddball G-man  "Special Agent Dale Cooper"  on Lynch's cryptic ABC-TV series  I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990)  perhaps  along with Velluto blu (1986)  his most famous role. MacLachlan's remarkable work as Agent Cooper earned him a Golden Globe award and a pair of Emmy nominations  as well as steady work in television and films  including a part as Ray Manzarek in the Oliver Stone film  The Doors (1991)  and villain "Cliff Vandercave" in the live action version of I Flintstones (1994).His career took a hit after he appeared in the infamous flop  Showgirls (1995). However  MacLachlan returned to prominence in the early 2000s with a re-occurring role on HBO's Sex and the City (1998)  as well as a starring role in the TV movie  Il mistero della fonte (2000)  and a turn as "Claudius" in director Michael Almereyda's version of Hamlet 2000 (2000). MacLachlan later took advantage of his resemblance to Cary Grant  when he played the classic actor's spirit in Scandalo a Londra (2004).MacLachlan has remained a popular actor with independent filmmakers  and he has also been a familiar face on television  appearing on the ABC-TV shows  In Justice (2006) and Desperate Housewives - I segreti di Wisteria Lane (2004).,1959-02-22,Yakima  Washington  USA,,,0,1

nm0001539,Hayley Mills,Hayley Catherine Rose Vivien Mills,160,Born Hayley Catherine Rose Vivien Mills in London  England  on Thursday  April 18th  1946  she is the daughter of the great actor Sir John Mills and the well-known novelist-playwright Mary Hayley Bell. Her sister is the actress Juliet Mills. She grew up in her parents' home  an outgoing  funny child  and  because she spent so much time with her parents and their friends  very intelligent. When she went to boarding school at age nine  however  she became very shy around kids her own age. She found solace in theater productions at her school. She was noticed playing at her parent's home in 1958 by director J. Lee Thompson  who immediately cast her opposite  of her father in the thriller Questione di vita o di morte (1959). Her debut performance turned heads around the world  from Germany  where she won an award at the Berlin Film Festival  to Hollywood  when Walt Disney came knocking at her door. He signed her to a five-year contract. For her first film for the studio  Il segreto di Pollyanna (1960)  she won critical raves  box-office success  and a special Juvenile Academy Award. Her second Disney film  Il cowboy con il velo da sposa (1961)  in which she played identical twin sisters  was by far  much more popular. She continued to appear in routine Disney films like I figli del capitano Grant (1962) and Magia d'estate (1963)  as well as films outside the studio like Whistle Down the Wind (1961)  based on her mother's novel  and Il giardino di gesso (1964)  again co-starring with her father. Though Disney gave her a somewhat more adult role in the mystery film Giallo a Creta (1964)  she had begun to tire of her sunny  innocent Pollyanna image and personality. After completing F.B.I. operazione gatto (1965)  she left the studio for good  (except for one more Disney movie  Trappola per genitori II (1986) made 20 plus years later). F.B.I. operazione gatto (1965) was very much a success  as was her first post-Disney film  Columbia's Guai con gli angeli (1966). Then  she shocked her fans by appearing in the comedy Questo difficile amore (1966) with her father. There was an even bigger surprise in store when she fell in love with the film's director  Roy Boulting  who was 33 years her senior. She lived with Boulting for five years after he divorced his wife. They married in 1971 and had a son  Crispian Mills  on Thursday  January 18th  1973. By this time  he'd taken control of her career  and  as a result  she made many bad film choices that left critics and audiences cold. By 1976  her film career was pretty much tanked. She divorced Boulting that year and moved in with actor Leigh Lawson  with whom she had a son  Jason. They separated in 1984. She appeared in three TV-movie sequels to Il cowboy con il velo da sposa (1961) in the late 1980's  and also appeared in the BBC miniseries The Flame Trees of Thika (1981) and the TV series Good Morning  Miss Bliss (1987)  later re-titled Bayside School (1989). She hasn't done much film work in several years  preferring to concentrate on her burgeoning career in theater. Her greatest success in theater  so far  has been the role of Anna in "The King and I"  which she has played in many touring stage productions throughout the 1990 decade.,1946-04-18,Marylebone  London  England  UK,,,1,1

nm0001543,Gretchen Mol,Gretchen Mol,168,Gretchen Mol was born November 8  1972  in Deep River  Connecticut  the daughter of a school principal and his artist wife. Deep River is a small community located on the Chester Bowles Highway (Rt. 9)  nine miles northwest of Old Saybrook (home of the legendary Katharine Hepburn)  within commuting distance of New York City. The young Gretchen was bit by the acting bug and participated in high school theatrics  then moved to the Big Apple as a teenager to study acting and musical theater at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and at the William Esper Studio.Although only 5'6" tall--too short for a traditional modeling career--her unique beauty brought her modeling jobs as she pursued her dream of becoming a professional actress. She began appearing in magazines in 1994  meanwhile working at such time-honored Manhattan jobs as restaurant hat-check girl. It was while working that gig she was discovered by a talent agent. The agent landed her her first acting job  a TV commercial for Coca-Cola. She continued to hone her acting skills in summer stock  appearing in such productions as "Bus Stop"  "No Exit" and "Godspell".The 23-year-old Gretchen made her film debut in Spike Lee's Girl 6 - Sesso in linea (1996)  a small role that came to her  as luck would have it  after she had gone for an audition for the soap opera Sentieri (1952). Her career began to take off  and she appeared in small parts  mostly "girlfriend" roles  in such films as Il giocatore - Rounders (1998) starring 'Matt Damon' (qav) and in Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998)  opposite Kenneth Branagh and Leonardo DiCaprio.Gretchen was touted as the "Next Big Thing" after appearing on the cover of the September 1998 issue of "Vanity Fair". Her most memorable role up to that time was as a mobster's moll in the minor cult classic Donnie Brasco (1997)  which was mostly remembered for cinematic turns by Al Pacino  Johnny Depp and Anne Heche. Nonetheless  her beauty and presence led "Vanity Fair" to hype the beautiful blonde  heralding the arrival of a major new star. She seemed poised to move up to featured roles. but the announcement turned out to be premature. Brunette Angelina Jolie proved to be Hollywood's Next "It" girl.During the seven years that followed the "Vanity Fair" cover story  Mol continued to appear in films and on the stage  including the part of Jennie in the London and New York productions of Neil LaBute's "The Shape of Things" in 2001 (she also appeared in the film version  The Shape of Things (2003)). The good reviews she got proved that she was not just another pretty face. In 2004 she displayed her singing and dancing chops by playing Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of "Chicago."She worked steadily  appearing in another small role in Woody Allen's Accordi & disaccordi (1999)  and eventually won the lead in David E. Kelley TV series Girls Club (2002). The series bombed  however  and was canceled after only two episodes. Nevertheless  the intervening period allowed her to develop as an actress. In 2004 the blonde beauty finally had the role that proved to be her acting breakthrough: brunette 1950s "stag queen" Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page (2005). Many brunettes have gone blonde  but Mol--the blonde who went brunette--rocked the screen with her presence. Her embodiment of the legendary Page garnered excellent reviews and propelled the flick into art house hit status.Mol married film director Tod Williams on June 1  2004  and they became parents a little over three years later  when a son  Ptolemy John Williams  was born on October 10  2007.,1972-11-08,Deep River  Connecticut  USA,,,0,2

nm0001590,Chazz Palminteri,Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri,189,Bronx-born and raised Chazz Palminteri was a natural choice to continue the Italianate torch in film. In the tradition set forth in the 1970s by such icons as director Martin Scorsese and actors Robert De Niro  Al Pacino  John Cazale and Joe Pesci  Palminteri has brought grit  muscle and an evocative realism to the sidewalks of his New York neighborhood  violent as they are and were.Chazz was born Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri in 1952 in the Bronx  New York  the son of Rose  a homemaker  and Lorenzo Palminteri  a bus driver. He grew up in a tough area of the Bronx  giving him the life lessons that would later prove very useful to his career. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and started out pursuing his craft in 1973 studying at the Actor's Studio. He appeared off-Broadway in the early 1980s while paying his dues as a bouncer and doorman in nightclubs  among other jobs.In 1986 he headed west and found that his ethnic qualifications was well-suited for getting tough-talker parts. Slick attorneys  unflinching hoods and hard-nosed cops were all part of his ethnic streetwise persona in such TV shows as Oltre la legge - L'informatore (1987)  Matlock (1986) and Hill Street giorno e notte (1981). In films he started off playing a 1930s-style gangster in Sylvester Stallone's Oscar - Un fidanzato per due figlie (1991). Although his roles were sharp  well-acted and with a distinct edge to them  there was nothing in them to show that he was capable of stronger leading parts.In 1988 he wrote for himself a play entitled "A Bronx Tale " a powerful one-man stage commentary in which he depicted his bruising childhood in great detail  which included witnessing gangland slayings. Palminteri brought each and every character to life (18 in all) in this autobiographical piece -- his friends  enemies  even his own family. He showcased for years in both Los Angeles and New York  finally sparking the interest of his film idol  Robert De Niro. DeNiro  wanting to direct for the first time  saw the potential of this project and brought both it and the actor/writer to the screen. Palminteri played one of the flashier roles  Sonny  a gangster  in the movie version. An unknown film commodity at the time  Chazz had stubbornly refused to sell his stage property (the offers went into the seven figures) unless he was part of the package as both actor and screenwriter. DeNiro  who became his mentor  backed him up all the way  and the rest is history. Bronx (1993)  which featured his actress/producer/wife Gianna Palminteri  earned strong reviews.At age 41 Palminteri had become an "overnight" star. Other important projects quickly fell his way. He received a well-deserved Oscar nomination the following year for his portrayal of a Runyonesque hit man in Woody Allen's hilarious jazz-era comedy Pallottole su Broadway (1994). He was on the right side of the law in both La famiglia Perez (1995)  his first romantic lead  and then the classic crimer I soliti sospetti (1995). He played the ill-fated brute in Diabolique (1996) and wrote a second screenplay  Infedeli per sempre (1996)  in which he again plays a hit man  terrorizing both Cher and Ryan O'Neal.Though Palminteri was invariably drawn into a rather tight-fitting  often violent typecast  it has been a secure and flashy one that continues to run strong into the millennium. Surprisingly  the one obvious show he missed out on was HBO's I Soprano (1999). True to form his trademark flesh-lipped snarl was spotted in gritty urban settings playing a "Hell's Kitchen" cop in One Eyed King - La tana del diavolo (2001) starring actor/producer Armand Assante; a pool hustler and mentor in Poolhall Junkies (2002); a mob boss in In the Fix (2005); a dirty cop in Running (2006); the titular scam artist as Yonkers Joe (2008); a karaoke-loving Italian psychiatrist in Once More with Feeling (2009); and an abusive husband and father in Mighty Fine (2012).Other millennium filming includes starring presences in Body Armour - In difesa del nemico (2007)  The Dukes (2007)  the title conman as Yonkers Joe (2008)  Once More with Feeling (2009) and Mighty Fine (2012)  as well as prime supports in Running (2006)  Guida per riconoscere i tuoi santi (2006)  Push (2006)  Jolene (2008)  Last I Heard (2013)  Legend (2015)  Vault (2019)  Clover (2020). TV crime continues to occupy his time as well  clocking in such series' credits as Kojak (2005)  Rizzoli & Isles (2010) and Godfather of Harlem (2019). Occasionally he will lighten up -- as in his recurring role as Shorty on the popular sitcom Modern Family (2009).,1952-05-15,New York City  New York  USA,,,0,2

nm0001593,Anna Paquin,Anna Helene Paquin,163,Anna Paquin is the first millennial to have received an Academy Award nomination for acting  and the first to win.She was born in Winnipeg  Manitoba  Canada  in 1982  to Mary (Brophy)  an English teacher from Wellington  New Zealand  and Brian Paquin  a Canadian phys-ed teacher. Anna moved to her mother's native country when she was four years old. Her first acting job ever was at age nine in the film Lezioni di piano (1993)  which she ended up being cast in because it was shot in New Zealand. At age 16  she relocated to Los Angeles where she completed her last two years of high school (graduating in 2000). She then moved to New York where she attended Columbia University for one year. Between 2001 and 2004 she worked almost exclusively on stage in both New York and London.

nm0001594,Anne Parillaud,Anne Parillaud,168,Anne Parillaud was born in Paris  France on May 6  1960 and even though all her travels took her to many lands  is still a Paris resident. Anne studied ballet in school  and her first appearance was in the film Un amour de sable (1977) where she played "La jeune fille avec un petit chat" ("The girl with a kitten"). However  her first real role was as "Estelle" in Slip (1978) and  even though she had only appeared in this film during summer vacation  by then she had caught the show business bug. Anne was in eight other films  and then she gave her breakout performance in her signature role as "Nikita" in the wildly popular Nikita (1990)  which spun off the American remake Nome in codice: Nina (1993) starring Bridget Fonda  and the USA Network television series Nikita (1997) starring Peta Wilson. Anne had taken judo lessons for three months to prepare for this part. Anne said that when acting  she can abandon herself; indeed the character Nikita is nothing like her. Anne hates guns and even said of Nikita: "For a while  she was in me like a demon".When it comes to which films and directors to work with  Anne has her one rule: it must touch her heart. Obviously director Luc Besson touched her heart  they had a daughter together  but the couple separated shortly after Nikita (1990); (in 1997  Besson was briefly married to Milla Jovovich  but they divorced). Anne traveled to America to do several films  including Amore all'ultimo morso (1992)  in which she plays a French vampire. She said of her character "Marie"  that she wasn't born a vampire  didn't decide to be one; in that sense  the movie is a parable about dealing with the problem of being different in society. And difference equates to loneliness. Anne is still busy appearing in movies. Offscreen  Anne enjoys simple pleasures such as dancing  and talking with friends. And she is always led by her heart  Anne says she is someone who lives by impulse first. Her many fans would say it seems she has made a lot of right choices.,1960-05-06,Paris  France,,,2,1
nm0001597,Mandy Patinkin,Mandel Bruce Patinkin,182,Mandy Patinkin was born Mandel Bruce Patinkin in Chicago  Illinois  to Doris "Doralee" (Sinton)  a homemaker and cookbook writer  and Lester Patinkin  who operated two scrap metal plants. He is of Russian Jewish and Latvian Jewish descent. Growing up  he began singing in synagogue choirs at the age of 13-14 and still continues to use his fantastic voice in musicals and in recordings. Attending Juilliard  he became good friends with actor Kelsey Grammer and upon hearing that Cin cin (1982) was auditioning for the role of Dr. Frasier Crane he immediately put Grammer's name forward for the role. Rumours persist about Patinkin's sudden departure from Criminal Minds (2005). He simply failed to show up one day for a table read. He has contacted the entire cast to explain what is referred to as "personal reasons" for leaving. It seems that although Patinkin was prepared for the show to include violence the actual level of violence portrayed was unacceptable to the actor. He left to do more light hearted work. Patinkin supports many charities including: PAX  Doctors Without Borders  Americans for Peace Now  The September 11th Fund  Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America and Gilda's Club.,1952-11-30,Chicago  Illinois  USA,,,0,2

nm0001605,Amanda Peet,Amanda Peet,169,Amanda Peet was born and raised in New York City. She is the daughter of Penny (Levy)  a social worker  and Charles Peet  a lawyer  and has an older sister. Her father was of mostly English and German ancestry  and her mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany  Russia  and Hungary). Peet's great-grandfathers were politician Samuel Levy and showbiz impresario S.L. Rothafel.Peet made an unconventional stage debut at the age of three  when she jumped onto the stage during a play. Yet  despite this early start  she later studied acting more as a hobby than anything else. She studied history at Columbia University  where a drama professor convinced her to audition for acting teacher Uta Hagen  with whom she later went on to study for a four-year period. During this time  she participated in the off-Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's "Awake and Sing." She supported herself during the audition phase of her career by working as a waitress and with the residual checks she received from a Skittles candy commercial. Perseverance and hard work paid off  and  in 1995  she was cast in a guest-starring role on the hit series Law & Order - I due volti della giustizia (1990).Her feature film debut came in 1995 with the movie Animal Room (1995).

She did  however  meet her boyfriend Brian Van Holt on the set of indie movie Whipped - Ragazzi al guinzaglio (2000). Her turn as the ditzy hit-woman with the heart of gold in the hit comedy FBI - Protezione testimoni (2000)  opposite Bruce Willis  took her from supporting role status to leading lady.

nm0001608,Barry Pepper,Barry Robert Pepper,178,Barry Robert Pepper was born on April 4  1970  in Campbell River  British Columbia  Canada. He has two older brothers named Alex and Doug Pepper. The Peppers didn't stick around Campbell River for too long. They had been building a ship in their backyard for years. When Barry was five years old  the ship was done and the family set sail. The ship  named "The Moonlighter " was a 50-foot craft that would be their home for the next five years. They navigated through the South Pacific islands  using only a sextant and the stars as guides. While visiting such exotic locales as Fiji and Tahiti  Barry was educated through correspondence courses and sometimes enrolled in public schools. He grew up around Polynesian children and credits them for his love of dance  music and other expressive arts. Barry had plenty of time to practice his newfound loves  too. Without television as entertainment on the ship  the family relied on games and sketch acting for fun. When the five-year cruise was over  the Peppers returned to their native Canada  where they set up shop on a small island off the West Coast near Vancouver. They built a farm on the outskirts of a small artists' town  which was populated mainly by hippies  poets  musicians and other craftsmen. While in high school  Barry was enthusiastic about art and excelled in sports. In addition to playing volleyball  he was an excellent rugby player. He graduated in 1988 from George P. Vanier High School in Courtenay and then enrolled in college and majored in marketing and graphic design  but after getting involved with the Vancouver Actors Studio  he changed his course. Once again  he was using "the stars" to navigate. Barry landed his first role on Madison (1993) (a sort of Canadian 90210) and other prominent television series before moving on to more prestigious roles in the US. Television movies followed  most notably the mini-series Titanic (1996)  which costarred George C. Scott. Still  Barry's career really wasn't taking off. He was a hard-working actor  but not a star. That all changed in 1998. After a string of big screen duds  Pepper obtained his breakthrough role as a Bible-quoting sniper in Steven Spielberg's WW II drama Salvate il soldato Ryan (1998). With the success of the film came sudden stardom for its cast--complete with photo spreads  interviews and even some Oscar buzz. Barry followed the film with a small but noteworthy role in the blockbuster  Nemico pubblico (1998) opposite Will Smith and Gene Hackman. Next he co-starred in an Oscar-worthy film starring Tom Hanks: Stephen King's Il miglio verde (1999). Barry received much critical acclaim in 2001 for his portrayal of Roger Maris in the made-for-cable drama about the 1961 home run race between Maris and Mickey Mantle called 61* (2001).,1970-04-04,Campbell River  British Columbia  Canada,,,0,1

nm0001614,Lori Petty,Lori Lee Petty,169,After this feisty  kinetic  highly offbeat actress from Chattanooga  Tennessee  broke into TV in the 1980s  she immediately set herself apart from the norm with the mini-movie Il motel della paura (1987). This rather inauspicious beginning would also set Lori Petty off on a career as a fighter and a misfit  types for which she would be best known.She spent her childhood traveling the US with her father  a Pentecostal minister. Her keen talents first lent themselves toward being a graphic artist in Omaha  Nebraska  but an impulsive desire to act quickly took precedence and soon she was off to New York  where she took acting classes and pounded the pavement for jobs.Going nowhere fast  she eventually headed for Los Angeles and finally found an "in". Following a number of mediocre TV roles  she won a bit of attention on the short-lived series Booker (1989) as a lippy secretary  then hit paydirt in secondary roles as an outrageous Cyndi Lauper wannabe in Cadillac Man - Mister occasionissima (1990) and as Patrick Swayze's ex-girlfriend/waitress who hooks up with Keanu Reeves in Point Break - Punto di rottura (1991).It looked like mainstream stardom might happen for the tomboy actress  especially after getting cast as Geena Davis' bratty baseball-playing sister in the highly successful Ragazze vincenti (1992).However  Lori was an intriguing  kooky sort and difficult to cast. Such disparate roles as a kind-hearted animal trainer in Free Willy - Un amico da salvare (1993) and the sole female recruit in Pauly Shore's inane comedy Operazione Desert Storm (1994) only proved the point.She seemed bent towards playing scrappy figures alongside the big action guys but started off on the wrong foot when she was replaced by Sandra Bullock in Sylvester Stallone's Demolition Man (1993) due to "artistic differences".She did play a lone female cop in the thriller Il distintivo di vetro (1994)  then found her true calling as the bizarre cartoon heroine Tank Girl (1995)  which was billed as "a post-apocalyptic comedy".The crop-haired  tough-as-nails actress has been taking it to the limit ever since  most recently co-starring with the similarly styled Gina Gershon in Prey for Rock & Roll (2003) as members of a punk rock band.,1963-10-14,Chattanooga  Tennessee  USA,,,0,0

nm0001627,Sidney Poitier,Sidney L. Poitier,189,A native of Cat Island  The Bahamas (although born  two months prematurely  in Miami during a visit by his parents)  Poitier grew up in poverty as the son of farmers Evelyn (nee Outten) and Reginald James Poitier  who also drove a cab. He had little formal education and at the age of 15 was sent to Miami to live with his brother  in order to forestall a growing tendency toward delinquency. In the U.S.  he experienced the racial chasm that divides the country  a great shock to a boy coming from a society with a majority of African descent.At 18  he went to New York  did menial jobs and slept in a bus terminal toilet. A brief stint in the Army as a worker at a veteran's hospital was followed by more menial jobs in Harlem. An impulsive audition at the American Negro Theatre was rejected so forcefully that Poitier dedicated the next six months to overcoming his accent and improving his performing skills. On his second try  he was accepted. Spotted in rehearsal by a casting agent  he won a bit part in the Broadway production of "Lysistrata"  for which he earned good reviews. By the end of 1949  he was having to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for Darryl F. Zanuck in the film Uomo bianco tu vivrai! (1950). His performance as a doctor treating a white bigot got him plenty of notice and led to more roles. Nevertheless  the roles were still less interesting and prominent than those white actors routinely obtained. But seven years later  after turning down several projects he considered demeaning  Poitier got a number of roles that catapulted him into a category rarely if ever achieved by an African American man of that time  that of leading man. One of these films  La parete di fango (1958)  earned Poitier his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Five years later  he won the Oscar for I gigli del campo (1963)  the first African American to win for a leading role.He remained active on stage and screen as well as in the burgeoning Civil Rights movement. His roles in Indovina chi viene a cena? (1967) and La scuola della violenza (1967) were landmarks in helping to break down some social barriers between blacks and whites. Poitier's talent  conscience  integrity  and inherent likability placed him on equal footing with the white stars of the day. He took on directing and producing chores in the 1970s  achieving success in both arenas.,1927-02-20,Miami  Florida  USA,,,1,6
nm0001629,Kevin Pollak,Kevin Elliot Pollak,165,Kevin Pollak was born in San Francisco in 1957  to Elaine and Robert Pollak. A stand-up comedy performer at age 10  he turned professional comedian at 18 and rose to the top of the San Francisco comedy scene by 25. Pollak refocused thereafter on acting in what would be a wise and profitable career move. Landing his first film role in George Lucas' Willow (1988)  directed by Ron Howard  became the wind beneath his wings  and he has been sailing ever since. Critically noticed for his role in Avalon (1990)  it was Rob Reiner's Codice d'onore (1992) that shot him up the credit's list. Not only starring in two of his own HBO stand-up comedy specials  Pollak returned to the live stand-up stage in 2001  headlining a sold out 20 city tour. Comedy Central named him on their Top 100 Comedians Of All Time list. Most recently  he co-stars on the multi-award-winning Amazon Prime HIT series  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.,1957-10-30,San Francisco  California  USA,,,1,0
nm0001631,Sarah Polley,Sarah Polley,157,Sarah Polley is an actress and director renowned in her native Canada for her political activism. Blessed with an extremely expressive face that enables directors to minimize dialog due to her uncanny ability to suggest a character's thoughts  Polley has become a favorite of critics for her sensitive portraits of wounded and conflicted young women in independent films.She was born into a show business family: her stepfather  Michael Polley  appeared with her in the movie Le avventure del Barone di Munchausen (1988) and on the television series La strada per Avonlea (1990); and her mother  Diane Polley  was an actress and casting director. It was her mother's connections that launched Sarah  at her own insistence  on an acting career at the age of four  following in the footsteps of her older half-brother Mark Polley. A second half-brother  John Buchan  is a casting director and producer.Her career as a child actress shifted into high gear when she was cast as the Cockney waif Jody Turner in Lantern Hill (1989)  for which she won a Gemini Award  the Canadian equivalent of the Emmy  in 1992. Produced by Kevin Sullivan  the film was based on the book by Lucy Maud Montgomery  author of Anna dai capelli rossi (1985). When Sullivan created a television series based on Montgomery's work  he cast Polley in the lead role of Sara Stanley in La strada per Avonlea (1990). The series propelled Polley into the first rank of Canadian TV stars and made her independently wealthy by the age of fourteen.Her personal life was deeply affected by the death of her mother Diane from cancer shortly after her 11th birthday  a development that ironically paralleled the fictional life of her character Sara. Highly intelligent and politically progressive at a young age  Polley eventually rebelled against what she felt was the Americanization of the series after it was picked up by the Disney Channel for distribution in the US  eventually dropping out of the show. Though she does not blame her parents  she remains publicly disenchanted over the loss of her childhood and  in October 2003  said she is working on a script about a twelve-year-old girl on a TV show.Polley  who picked up a second Gemini Award for her performance in the TV series Straight Up (1996)  subsequently quit acting and high school to turn her attention to politics  positioning herself on the extreme left of Canada's left-of-center New Democratic Party. The publicity ensuing from her losing some teeth after being slugged by an Ontario policeman during a protest against the Conservative provincial government  plus the stinging cynicism from some other activists unimpressed by her celebrity  led her to lower her political profile temporarily and return to acting in Atom Egoyan's film Il dolce domani (1997). It was her appearance as Nicole  the teenage girl injured in a school bus accident who serves as the conscience of the small town rent by the tragedy  that first brought her to the attention of critics in the US. In Canada  the role was heralded by critics as her successful breakthrough to adult roles. It was her second film with Egoyan  who wrote the part with her in mind when he adapted the novel by Russell Banks  who  ironically  is American. Predictions of an Academy Award nomination and future stardom were part of the critical consensus  and she received her first Best Actress Genie nomination from Canada's Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and the Best Supporting Actress award from the Boston Society of Film Critics. It was the buzz created at the Sundance Festival  where her starring role in the film Guinevere (1999) was showcased  when the entertainment media crowned her the it-girl of 1999.Intensely private and extremely ambivalent about the personal cost of celebrity and the Hollywood ethos Fame is the Name of the Game  Polley could be seen as rebelling against the expectations of mainstream cinema when she embarked on a career path that took her out of the spotlight thrown by the harsh lights of the Hollywood hype/publicity machine after shooting the film Go - Una notte da dimenticare (1999). She dropped out of Cameron Crowe's Quasi famosi (2000)  the US$60 million mega-hyped vehicle that was supposed to make her a mainstream star in the US  choosing to return to Canada to make the CDN$1.5 million The Law of Enclosures (2000) for Genie Award-winner John Greyson  a director she admires greatly. The film grossed poorly in Canada and was not released in the US  but it did garner Polley her second Genie nomination for Best Actress. While her replacement in Quasi famosi (2000) went on to win an Oscar nomination and a career above the title in glossy Hollywood films  she took a wide variety of parts  large and small  in independent films  including significant roles in the ensemble pieces Le bianche tracce della vita (2000) and Il mistero dell'acqua (2000); bit parts in eXistenZ (1999) and Love Come Down (2000); and the lead in No Such Thing (2001). Her choice of projects showed her to be a questing spirit more focused on learning the art of her craft than on stardom.She has said that her choice of film roles  eschewing mainstream Hollywood movies for chancier  non-commercial independent fare  was the result of an ethical decision on her part to make films with social importance. A less-observant viewer might think that the rebel Polley played in her political life that had previously manifested itself in her profession was now driving her to the verge of career suicide in terms of popularity  marketability  and choice of future roles. However  that interpretation does not recognize the extraordinary talent that will always keep her in demand by directors  if not casting agents  with an eye on the opening weekend box office. One must understand Polley's career progression in light of her attendance at the Canadian Film Centre's directors program and her production of short films  including Don't Think Twice (1999) and the highly praised I Shout Love (2001). Polley is a cinema artist. This woman wants to make  and will make films. Thus  we can understand her career choices as a desire to work with and understand the technique of some of the best directors in film  including David Cronenberg  Michael Winterbottom  and Hal Hartley.Polley is as renowned for her intelligence as for her remarkable talent. The problem of the intelligent person in the acting field is that the actor  as artist  in not ultimately in control of their medium  and it is artistic control that is the hallmark of the great artist. The controlling intelligence on a movie set is the director  and her attendance at the Canadian Film Centre has given her a new perspective on acting. The actor  she says  should not try to give a complete performance for the camera (that is  control the representation on film) but must remember that the function of the actor is to give the director as much coverage as possible as a film  as well as a performance  is made in the editing room. According to Polley  this realization  that the film actor exists to serve the director  has given her new enthusiasm for acting. Thus  her career  and her career choices  can be seen as a quest for knowledge about the art of cinema  a journey whose fruition we will see in her future feature work as both actor and director.,1979-01-08,Toronto  Ontario  Canada,,,1,2

nm0001633,Annie Potts,Anne Hampton Potts,160,Annie Potts is an American film  television  and stage actress. She is known for her roles in popular 1980s films such as Ghostbusters (1984) and Pretty in Pink (1986). She made her debut on the big screen in 1978 in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer comedy film Corvette Summer  with Mark Hamill  for which she was nominated for an Golden Globe. In 2017 she was cast to portray Meemaw in Young Sheldon  a spin-off of the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Potts also voiced voiced Bo Peep in the animated films Toy Story (1995)  Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 4 (2019).Interested in stage and film at an early age  Annie Potts attended Stephens College in Missouri  enrolling in the theater studies course  followed by graduate work in California. At the age of 20  she married her college sweetheart  Steven Hartley. Only a short time later  she and her husband were in serious automobile accident in Sumner  Washington -- their Volkswagen bus was demolished by two drivers who were drag racing. Steve lost a leg  and Annie had multiple fractures (resulting in a traumatic arthritis that still persists). Early roles were primarily in television  such as Black Market Baby (1977)  but her presence moved up with an appearance in the mega-hit Ghostbusters (Acchiappafantasmi) (1984)  and then she hit the big time with a seven-year stint as one of the stars of Quattro donne in carriera (1986). A brief period in Love & War (1992) ended with the cancellation of the show  about which she remains resentful.,1952-10-28,Nashville  Tennessee  USA,,,3,3

After an eight year courtship  she married him on 1 May 1967. As their marriage was winding down  she began studying karate and acting.

nm0001639,Alex Proyas,Alexander Proyas,175,Alex Proyas has moved effortlessly between helming TV commercials and music videos to feature films. Born to Greek parents in Egypt  Proyas relocated to Australia with his family when he was three years old. He began making films at age ten and went on to attend the Australian Film Television and Radio School along with Jane Campion and Jocelyn Moorhouse. Proyas collaborated with Campion on two of her shorts  A Girl's Own Story (1986)  for which he wrote and performed a song  and Passionless Moments (1983)  which he photographed. Proyas' own short  Groping (1980)  had earned him some attention at festival screenings in Sydney and London. Also while still a student  the enterprising novice formed Meaningful Eye Contact  a production company. Spirits of the Air  Gremlins of the Clouds (1987) marked Proyas' feature debut as director and screenwriter. Set in a post-apocalyptic world  the film  with its stylized production design and aural texture  was atypical of standard Australian fare  more closely resembling a longform music video. Critics admired the director's vision  but felt the overall result was lacking. Proyas continued to hone his craft helming TV advertisements for products like Nike  Nissan and Swatch (earning kudos from advertising associations in both Australia and England) and directing videos for such artists as Sting  INXS and Crowded House. In 1993 Proyas was tapped to helm the screen adaptation of James O'Barr's comic strip Il corvo - The Crow (1994). During production  star Brandon Lee died of an accidental gunshot wound (ironically  the film's story revolves around his character's resurrection). His death cast a pall over the remainder of the filming and its subsequent theatrical release  although reviews were generally favorably  most singling out the production values which created a colorless rain-soaked wasteland that invoked comparisons with Ridley Scott's seminal Blade Runner (1982) and Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Made for about $14 million  it grossed close to $50 million domestically. Proyas seemed set to move on to other projects and was announced as the director of Casper (1995)  but left the project and was replaced by Brad Silberling. After a four-year absence he returned with another thriller  Dark City (1998)  about an amnesiac who may or may not have been a serial killer. Garage Days (2002) marked Proyas' return to his homeland  Australia: the movie tells the story of a young Sydney garage band desperately trying to make it big in the competitive world of rock 'n' roll. In 2004 Proyas returned to Hollywood: he directed Io  robot (2004)  a science-fiction film suggested by the 'Isaac Asimov' short story compilation of the same name that starred Will Smith. It was a box office success  but met with mixed reactions by readers and fans of the Asimov stories.,1963-09-23,Egypt,,,0,0

He and his family moved to County Cork  Ireland  when the actor was nearly a year old  and then  at the age of 3  his father left the family  leaving his mother to care for Jonny and his 3 younger brothers alone.Rhys Meyers grew up with a tumultuous childhood and being permanently expelled from school at age 16. Happy to be out of school  he began spending time in a local pool hall where he was discovered by Hubbard Casting. The casting agents were talent-spotting for the David Puttnam production of War of the Buttons (1994)  and asked Rhys Meyers to appear for an audition. After three days of auditions  however  he did not get the role  and Rhys Meyers gave up on his acting aspirations. Soon afterward  he received a call to audition for a national ad campaign for Knorr soup  and though embarrassed by the attention from the ad  he soon found himself considered for a major film. His movie acting debut was a very small role in the film Un uomo senza importanza (1994)  where his simple cast credit is as "First Young Man". His first lead role was in the film The Disappearance of Finbar (1996).

Kim was reunited with her "Witch Mountain" co-star Ike Eisenmann for the hilariously horrible made-for-TV horror howler Il cane infernale (1978) (Richards did a career interview for the recent DVD of this film). Kim played more mature adult roles in the mid 80s movies Meatballs 2: porcelloni in vacanza (1984) and Ultima occasione (1985) in which Richards gives a performance as a teenage gang leader's brash girlfriend. Richards took a hiatus from acting to raise her four children Brook  Whitney  Chad and Kimberly. After a lengthy absence from the big screen  Kim Richards made a welcome comeback with a fine portrayal of Christina Ricci's bitter estranged mother in the excellent Black Snake Moan (2006). She's the sister of fellow actress Kyle Richards -- they appeared together in La macchina nera (1977) as James Brolin's daughters -- and Kathy Hilton  who is the mother of Paris Hilton.,1964-09-19,Mineola  New York  USA,,,2,3
nm0001669,Miranda Richardson,Miranda Jane Richardson,165,Miranda Richardson was born in Southport  Lancashire  England on March 3  1958  to Marian Georgina (Townsend) and William Alan Richardson  a marketing executive. She has one sister  eight years her senior. Her parents and sister are not involved in the performing arts. At an early age she performed in school plays  having shown a talent and desire to "turn herself into" other people. She has referred to it as "an emotional fusion; you think yourself into them". This mimicry could be of school friends or film stars.She left school (Southport High School for Girls) at the age of 17  and originally intended becoming a vet. She also considered studying English literature in college  but decided to concentrate on drama and enrolled at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (as did many well-known British actors). After three years she graduated and moved into repertory theatre. She became affiliated with the Library Theatre in Manchester in 1979  where she became an assistant stage manager. She obtained her Equity card  and after several regional productions  first appeared on the London stage (Moving at Queens Theatre) in 1981. British television roles soon followed  and then film.Since then  Miranda has moved into the international arena  and has made films in America  France and Spain. Television work (on both sides of the Atlantic) continues  as does some stage work. Her roles are diverse  but powerful and engaging. She has been quoted as stating "what I basically like is doing things I haven't done before" and this continually comes through in the variety of roles she has played in her career. She is also selective in the roles she takes  being uninterested in performing in the standard Hollywood fare  and preferring more offbeat roles. She was approached to play the Glenn Close role in Attrazione fatale (1987)  but found it "regressive in its attitudes". Her attitude is summed up by a quote from an interview that appeared in the New York Times (Dec 27 1992): "I would rather do many small roles on TV  stage or film than one blockbuster that made me rich but had no acting. And if that's the choice I have to make  I think I've already made it".According to "1994 Current Biography Yearbook"  she resides in South London with her two Siamese cats  Otis and Waldo. She has now moved to West London. Her hobbies include drawing  walking  gardening  fashion  falconry  and music. She  by her own admission  is a loner and lives rather modestly. An actor who studied with Ms Richardson at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre in the late 1970s described her as "a strong minded  specially gifted  rather pretty young woman who enjoys wearing jewelry. She wore toe rings  which in the late 1970s and especially in England  were a rarity and considered rather racy." He also remarked on her drive  even then  to be an actress of the highest caliber.,1958-03-03,Southport  Lancashire  England  UK,,,0,0

nm0001683,Roseanne Barr,Roseanne Cherrie Barr,163,Firebrand Roseanne Barr has long been one of America's funniest and most controversial comedians.She was born in Salt Lake City  Utah  to Helen (Davis)  a cashier and bookkeeper  and Jerome Hershel "Jerry" Barr  a salesman. Her family was Jewish  and had moved to the U.S. from Russia  Lithuania  and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She dropped out of high school when she was seventeen  and  after a car accident  was admitted to a mental institution  claiming she was having nightmares and memory loss. She left the institute less than a year later. At seventeen  she gave birth to her first daughter  Brandi Brown  and gave her up for adoption. She began working at a restaurant as a dishwasher and waitress. Her hilarious comments to the customers she waited on led her to doing stand-up comedy at the restaurant. She married Bill Pentland and they had three children together  Jessica  Jennifer  and Jacob Pentland.Roseanne worked doing stand-up comedy until her August 23  1985 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) thrust her into the limelight. In 1987  HBO offered her a show of her own  On Location: The Roseanne Barr Show (1987). It was canceled after a short time. In 1989  Roseanne starred opposite Meryl Streep and Ed Begley Jr. in She-Devil - Lei  il diavolo (1989). Though her first picture wasn't as successful as she might have hoped  her sitcom  Pappa e ciccia (1988)  debuted in 1988 and ran for 9 seasons on ABC  co-starring John Goodman. It dealt with real-life issues in a lower middle-class working family. During its first season on ABC  it leaped to #2 in the ratings. After the sitcom's first season  Roseanne gained notoriety when she gave a screeching  crotch-grabbing performance of "The Star Spangled Banner" at a baseball game.When Roseanne divorced her first husband  Bill Pentland  after 16 years of marriage in 1990 and married Pappa e ciccia (1988) co-star Tom Arnold only four days later  her sitcom was already beginning its downward spiral. In 1991  she started to be billed as Roseanne Arnold. Around this time  she began to claim that she  as well as her siblings  had been physically and sexually abused as a child. Both her siblings and parents denied the charges  and lie detector tests used on Roseanne's parents came back negative. The court battles led to ten years of estrangement with her parents and siblings. Her marriage with Arnold lasted four years before she filed for divorce from him for physical abuse and domestic violence. It is still not known if the accusations were true. Although she insisted that he hit her  she admits that he never abused her three children from her previous marriage:In 1996  she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won  but she was not there to accept it. Luckily  Tom Arnold's exit from "Roseanne" happened towards the end of the sixth season  allowing the show to have an almost smooth ending. However  after the sixth season of Pappa e ciccia (1988)  the plots started to run dry and ratings began to drop. During the season following her divorce  she insisted on being billed as simply "Roseanne." After Pappa e ciccia (1988) was canceled  she went on Broadway to play "The Wicked Witch of the West" in "The Wizard of Oz" to rave reviews.On Valentine's Day 1995  Roseanne married former bodyguard Ben Thomas. With Thomas  she had her tubal ligation surgery reversed in order to become pregnant with her fifth child  Buck Thomas. In 1997  she slowly began being billed as "Roseanne Thomas"  as in the last 11 episodes of Roseanne  as executive producer (she was still "Roseanne" in the cast credits). She guest-starred in La tata (1993) as Roseanne Thomas in late 1997. In 2002  she filed for divorce against Thomas for the second time (the first time  in 1998  she dropped the suit)  accusing him of being disturbed and claiming that he threatened to run off with their son.After the divorce  she began to study the Kabballah  a form of Jewish mysticism  and those around her said she became amazingly centered and stable. In the 2000s  she ended the feud with her parents and siblings and went back to being billed as Roseanne Barr. Today  Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas spends her time with her family in her home in El Segundo  California.Always outspoken  Roseanne began commenting on politics in earnest in the 2000s  and unsuccessfully ran for the Green Party's presidential nomination in 2012. She was subsequently chosen as the Peace and Freedom Party's candidate for President of the United States in '12  receiving 61 971 votes in the general election  and placing sixth. Her run is depicted in the documentary Roseanne for President! (2015).Initially a left-leaning liberal  she became considerably more right-wing throughout the 2010s. Her show Roseanne returned for a tenth season in 2018  to blockbuster ratings  but was canceled after Roseanne sent a racially-offensive tweet that capped off a longer run of incendiary comments.,1952-11-03,Salt Lake City  Utah  USA,,,3,4

nm0001691,Geoffrey Rush,Geoffrey Roy Rush,182,Geoffrey Roy Rush was born on July 6  1951  in Toowoomba  Queensland  Australia  to Merle (Bischof)  a department store sales assistant  and Roy Baden Rush  an accountant for the Royal Australian Air Force. His mother was of German descent and his father had English  Irish  and Scottish ancestry. He was raised in Brisbane  Queensland  after his parents split up.Rush attended Everton Park State High School during his formative years. His early interest in the theatre led to his 1971 stage debut at age 20 in "Wrong Side of the Moon" with the Queensland Theatre Company.Known for his classical repertory work over the years  he scored an unexpected hit with his Queensland role as Snoopy in the musical "You're a Good Man  Charlie Brown". A few years later he moved to France to study but subsequently returned to his homeland within a short time and continued work as both actor and director with the Queensland company ("June and the Paycock " "Aladdin " "Godspell " "Present Laughter " "The Rivals"). In the 1980s Rush became a vital member of the State Theatre Company of South Australia and showed an equally strong range there in such productions as "Revenger's Tragedy " "A Midsummer Night's Dream " "Mother Courage...and Her Children " "Blood Wedding " "Pal Joey " "Twelfth Night" and as The Fool in "King Lear".Rush made an inauspicious debut in films with the feature Hoodwink (1981)  having little more than a bit part  and didn't carry off his first major role until playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek in a movie production of Twelfth Night (1986). Yet  he remained a durable presence on stage with acclaimed productions in "The Diary of a Madman" in 1989 and "The Government Inspector" in 1991.Rush suffered a temporary nervous breakdown in 1992 due to overwork and anguish over his lack of career advancement. Resting for a time  he eventually returned to the stage. Within a few years film-goers finally began taking notice of Geoffrey after his performance in Figli della rivoluzione (1996). This led to THE role of a lifetime as the highly dysfunctional piano prodigy David Helfgott in Shine (1996). Rush's astonishing tour-de-force performance won him every conceivable award imaginable  including the Oscar  Golden Globe  British Film Award and Australian Film Institute Award."Shine" not only put Rush on the international film map  but atypically on the Hollywood "A" list as well. His rather homely mug was made fascinating by a completely charming  confident and captivating demeanor; better yet  it allowed him to more easily dissolve into a number of transfixing historical portrayals  notably his Walsingham in Elizabeth (1998) and Leon Trotsky in Frida (2002). He's also allowed himself to have a bit of hammy fun in such box office escapism as Mystery Men (1999)  Il mistero della casa sulla collina (1999)  Due amiche esplosive (2002)  Alla ricerca di Nemo (2003) and La maledizione della prima luna (2003). More than validating his early film success  two more Oscar nominations came his way in the same year for Quills - La penna dello scandalo (2000) (best actor) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) (support actor) in 2000. Geoffrey's amazing versatility continued into the millennium with his portrayal of the manic  volatile comedy genius Peter Sellers in the biopic Tu chiamami Peter (2004). He also merited attention as Lionel Logue in Il discorso del re (2010)  Basil Hunter in The Eye of the Storm (2011)  Hans Hubermann in Storia di una ladra di libri (2013)  artist/sculptor Alberto Giocometti in Final Portrait - L'arte di essere amici (2017) and Michael Kingley Storm Boy (2019).Rush's intermittent returns to the stage have included productions of "Marat-Sade " "Uncle Vanya " "Oleanna " "Hamlet" and "The Small Poppies". In 2009 he made his Broadway debut in "Exit the King" co-starring Susan Sarandon. His marriage (since 1988) to Aussie classical actress Jane Menelaus produced daughter Angelica (1992) and son James (1995). Menelaus  who has also performed with the State Theatre of South Australia  has co-starred on stage with Rush in "The Winter's Tale" (1987)  "Troilus and Cressida" (1989) and "The Importance of Being Earnest" (as Gwendolyn to his Jack Worthing). She also had featured roles in a few of his films  including Quills - La penna dello scandalo (2000) and The Eye of the Storm (2011).,1951-07-06,Toowoomba  Queensland  Australia,,,0,2

Written by Ernest Lehman  the film updated and expanded upon the director's early "wrong man" spy adventures of the 1930s  1940s and 1950s  including Il club dei 39 (1935)  Giovane e innocente (1937)  and Sabotatori (1942).

nm0001728,Wallace Shawn,Wallace Michael Shawn,157,American character actor and writer Wallace Shawn has one of those fun  mischievously homely faces just made to entertain. Though he got out of the starting gate rather slowly  he has since excelled on stage  television and film while managing to turn himself into a winner with his loser-type looks. Woody Allen's character in the movie Manhattan (1979) amusingly describes Wallace's character as "a homunculus"  which is a pretty fair description of this predominantly bald  wan  pucker-mouthed  butterball-framed  slightly lisping gent. Wallace made his movie debut in Allen's heralded classic playing Diane Keaton's ex-husband.Born to privilege on November 12  1943 in New York City  Wallace is the son of Cecille (Lyon)  a journalist  and William Shawn  renowned and long-time editor of The New Yorker. His brother is composer Allen Shawn. He was educated at both Harvard University  where he studied history  and Magdalen College  Oxford. Wallace initially taught English in India on a Fulbright scholarship  and then English  Latin and drama back in New York. However  a keen interest in writing and acting soon compelled him to leave his cushy position and pursue a stage career as both playwright and actor. During his distinguished career  Wallace turned out several plays. "Our Late Night"  the first of his works to be performed  was awarded an off-Broadway Obie in 1975. "A Thought in Three Parts" (1976); "The Mandrake" (1977)  which he translated from the original Italian and in which he made his acting debut; "Marie and Bruce" (1979); "Aunt Dan and Lemon" (1985) and "The Fever"  for which he received his second Obie Award for "Best New Play" during the 1990-91 season  then followed. A popular support player in both comedy and occasional drama  his assorted kooks  creeps  eggheads and schmucks possessed both endearing and unappetizing qualities. He earned some of his best early notices partnered with theatre director/actor Andre Gregory in the unique Louis Malle-directed film My Dinner with Andre (1981). Shawn co-wrote the improvisatory  humanistic piece and his brother  Allen Shawn  was the composer. Shawn and Gregory would collaborate again for Malle in another superb  original-concept film Vanya sulla 42esima strada (1994). Among the quality offbeat filming involving has been Bruce Paltrow's Un po' di sesso (1982); James Ivory's I bostoniani (1984); Stephen Frears' Prick Up - L'importanza di essere Joe (1987); Rob Reiner's La storia fantastica (1987); Alan Rudolph's Moderns (1988) and Mrs. Parker e il circolo vizioso (1994); Paul Bartel's Scene di lotta di classe a Beverly Hills (1989); and several others for Woody Allen: Radio Days (1987)  Ombre e nebbia (1991)  La maledizione dello scorpione di giada (2001) and Melinda e Melinda (2004). Since the 1990s  he has lent his vocal talents to a considerable number of animated pictures including In viaggio con Pippo (1995)  Toy Story - Il mondo dei giocattoli (1995) (and its sequel)  The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story (1998)  Gli Incredibili - Una 'normale' famiglia di supereroi (2004)  Chicken Little - Amici per le penne (2005) and Cenerentola e gli 007 nani (2006).Over the decades  Shawn has scurried about effortlessly in a number of television guest appearances including Taxi (1978)  Homicide  Life on the Street (1993)  Ally McBeal (1997)  Criminal Intent (2001) and Desperate Housewives - I segreti di Wisteria Lane (2004)  and has drummed up a few recurring roles for himself in the process  including I Robinson (1984)  Murphy Brown (1988)  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Crossing Jordan (2001). In the series Clueless (1996)  based on the highly successful of the same name Ragazze a Beverly Hills (1995)  Shawn revisited his role as the owlish high school teacher.,1943-11-12,New York City  New York  USA,,,0,0

nm0001754,Todd Solondz,Todd Solondz,170,Todd Solondz was born in Newark  New Jersey. One of his earliest jobs in the film industry was when  as a young man  he worked as a messenger for the Writers' Guild of America. During this time  he wrote several screenplays.Solondz's first color film with sync sound was the short "Schatt's Last Shot" (1985). Solondz played a high schooler who wants to get into Stanford  but cannot because his sadistic gym teacher fails him. He also has no luck seducing the girl he desires. It was a student film  and is still screened at NYU  where Solondz made it.Solondz's first feature was Fear  Anxiety & Depression (1989)  a piece about a writer (Solondz) writing a play and sending it to Samuel Beckett.Solondz found great critical acclaim with his second feature  Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)  a film about the cruelty of junior high school  parents  adult figures  and suburban life. The film won awards at Sundance  Berlin  and countless other festivals for its cruel realism  bitter humor  and unflinching portrayal of adolescence.His third feature effort  Happiness (1998)  was a wildly edgy and provocative film. The film revolves around a group of people who are miserable in their conventional lifestyles and pursue happiness in various forms of perverse sexuality. It featured a murderer  a rapist  a pedophile  and a man who harasses others with sexually obscene phone calls The film incited major controversy and was dropped by its original distributor  only to be picked up by another company. One of the particularly controversial aspects of the film was the element of the child psychologist as a repressed pedophile. In the film  he molests his son's friend at a sleep-over; but the character was sympathetic and deftly presented. Once again  the film was lauded with numerous awards and strong critical praise.Solondz made it clear he was not softening up with his next effort  Storytelling (2001)  which was about the artistic process. The film is divided into two halves  "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction." "Fiction" centers on a character in a creative-writing class  and "Non- Fiction" on a desperate filmmaker making a documentary about a depressed  listless  unmotivated teenager. "Fiction" concerns how fictional stories can be used to distort rather than illuminate reality  which is displayed via the exploits of the protagonist  a college student in a creative writing class. The film was in danger of being rated NC-17due to a racially charged sex scene. Solondz's response to the threat of the NC-17 was quite clever (and a bit tongue-in-cheek). Instead of trimming the scene  he simply blocked the image of the copulation with a large orange box. The film got an R rating. "Nonfiction" was loaded with social commentary. Topics covered in this part included a listless teenager and his overbearing family  homosexuality's current parallels to the scarlet letter  drug use  gun control in the home  and one's capability to murder.Solondz's next film was Palindromes (2004)  which was also controversial  due to the fact that the protagonist was played by eight people of differing size  race  and gender.Solondz has established himself as a consistently engaging and unique filmmaker  as opposed to just one more cookie-cutter conformist director making his movies on the Hollywood assembly line. He is a real writer and filmmaker  agent provocateur  and a force with which to be reckoned.,1959-10-15,Newark  New Jersey  USA,,,0,0

nm0001762,Jill St. John,Jill Arlyn Oppenheim,168,An incredible piece of 1960s eye candy  Jill St. John absolutely smoldered on the big screen  a trendy presence in lightweight comedy  spirited adventure and spy intrigue who appeared alongside some of Hollywood's most handsome male specimens. Although she was seldom called upon to do much more than frolic in the sun and playfully taunt and tempt as needed  this tangerine-topped stunner managed to do her job very  very well. A remarkably bright woman in real life  she was smart enough to play the Hollywood game to her advantage and did so for nearly two decades before looking elsewhere for fun and contentment.Jill St. John was actually born Jill Oppenheim in 1940 in Los Angeles. On stage and radio from age five  she was pretty much prodded by a typical stage mother. Making her TV debut in The Christmas Carol (1949)  Jill began blossoming and attracting the right kind of attention in her late teens. She signed with Universal Pictures at age 16 and made her film debut as a perky support in Summer Love (1957) starring then-hot John Saxon. Moving ahead  she filled the bill as a slightly dingy love interest in such innocuous fun as Il molto onorevole mr Pennypacker (1959)  Vacanze per amanti (1959)  Le 5 mogli dello scapolo (1963)  Dove vai sono guai! (1963) and Hotel delle vergini (1964).Whether the extremely photogenic Jill had talent (and she did!) or not never seemed to be a fundamental issue with casting agents. By the late '60s she had matured into a classy  ravishing redhead who not only came equipped with a knockout figure but some sly  suggestive one-liners as well that had her male co-stars (and audiences) more than interested. She skillfully traded sexy quips with Anthony Franciosa in the engaging TV pilot to the hit series Reporter alla ribalta (1968) and scored a major coup as the ever-tantalizing Tiffany Case  a ripe and ready Bond girl  in Agente 007 - Una cascata di diamanti (1971) opposite Sean Connery's popular "007" character. She also co-starred with Bob Hope in the dismal Otto in fuga (1967)  but the connection allowed her to be included in a number of the comedian's NBC specials over the years. A part of Frank Sinatra's "in" crowd  she worked with him on both Alle donne ci penso io (1963) and L'investigatore (1967).On camera  Jill's glossy femme fatales had a delightfully brazen  tongue-in-cheek quality to them. Off-camera  she lived the life of a jet-setter and was known for her romantic excursions with such eligibles as Jack Nicholson  David Frost  Bill Hudson  Roman Polanski and even Henry Kissinger. Of her four marriages  which included laundry heir Neil Dubin  the late sports car racer Lance Reventlow  son of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton  and easy-listening crooner Jack Jones  she seems to have found her soulmate in present husband Robert Wagner  whom she married in 1990 after an eight-year courtship. Jill first met Wagner when they were both just beginning their careers as contract players at 20th Century Fox. The couple share credits on several productions  notably Il club degli intrighi (1967) as well as the top-tier TV movies Intrigo a Montecarlo (1967) and Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (1989).Abandoning acting out of boredom  she has returned only on rare occasions. She played against type as a crazed warden in the prison drama The Concrete Jungle (1982) and has had some fun cameos alongside Wagner both on film (I protagonisti (1992)) and even TV (Seinfeld (1989)). In the late 1990s they started touring together in A.R. Gurney's popular two-person stage reading of "Love Letters." Jill's lifelong passion for cooking (her parents were restaurateurs) has turned profitable over the years. She has written a cookbook and appeared as a TV chef and "in-house" cooking expert on Good Morning America (1975). She also served as a food columnist for the USA Weekend newspaper.She was glimpsed more recently in the films The Calling (2002) and The Trip (2002) and she and Wagner had small roles as Santa and Mrs. Claus in the TV movie Northpole (2014).,1940-08-19,Los Angeles  California  USA,,,3,0

Kunen in an interview for People (10/22/84)  "so I started to mess around. It was unheard-of to mix talking on the phone with playing music. It was outrageous  It was blasphemy.",1954-01-12,Jackson Heights  Queens  New York City  New York  USA,,,1,3

nm0001772,Patrick Stewart,Patrick Stewart,178,Sir Patrick Stewart was born in Mirfield  Yorkshire  England  to Gladys (Barrowclough)  a textile worker and weaver  and Alfred Stewart  who was in the army. He was a member of various local drama groups from about age 12. He left school at age 15 to work as a junior reporter on a local paper; he quit when his editor told him he was spending too much time at the theatre and not enough working. Stewart spent a year as a furniture salesman  saving cash to attend drama school. He was accepted by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 1957. He made his professional debut in 1959 in the repertory theatre in Lincoln; he worked at the Manchester Library Theatre and a tour around the world with the Old Vic Company followed in the early 1960s.

nm0001774,Ben Stiller,Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller,170,Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller was born on November 30  1965  in New York City  New York  to legendary comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His father was of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent  and his mother was of Irish Catholic descent (she converted to Judaism).His parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars  wondering just why his parents were so popular. At a young age  he and his sister Amy Stiller would perform plays at home  wearing Amy's tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and  at age 10  began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy  awkward Stiller ... and then he would always get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular  good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus Giovani  carini e disoccupati (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film  which co-starred Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke.Before he got to Hollywood  he put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA  he performed in the Tony Award winner  "The House of Blue Leaves". While working on the play  Stiller shot a short spoof of Il colore dei soldi (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his American Playhouse: The House of Blue Leaves (1987) costar John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it on Il Saturday Night Live (1975). This led to his spending a year on the show in 1989.Stiller made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg's L'impero del sole (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take  he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show  The Ben Stiller Show (1992). He recruited fellow offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly satirical show. MTV ended up passing on it  but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately  the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out of work  although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation.For a while  Stiller had to settle for guest appearance work. While doing this  he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape enough together to make Giovani  carini e disoccupati (1994)  now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted. Ben continued to work steadily for a time  particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However  he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey's Il rompiscatole (1996). Although many critics were impressed  Jim Carrey's fans were not. In 1998  Tutti pazzi per Mary (1998) had propelled Stiller into the mainstream spotlight. He also starred in such hit movies as Tentazioni d'amore (2000) and Ti presento i miei (2000).,1965-11-30,New York City  New York  USA,,,1,2

Barcelona (1994) was inspired by his own experiences in Spain during the early 1980's  which was his first studio financed film. For The Last Days of Disco (1998) was loosely based on his travels and experiences in various nightclubs in Manhattan  and possibly at the Studio 54.,1952-01-25,Washington  District of Columbia  USA,,,0,0

nm0001786,George Takei,George Hosato Takei,168,Although primarily known for playing Hikaru Sulu in the television series Star Trek (1966) and the first six features  George Takei has had a varied career acting in television  feature films  live theater and radio. He also is a successful writer and community activist.George Takei was born Hosato Takei on April 20  1937  in Boyle Heights  Los Angeles  California. His mother  Fumiko Emily (Nakamura)  was born in Sacramento  to Japanese parents  and his father  Takekuma Norman Takei  worked in real estate and was born in Japan's Yamanashi Prefecture. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor  George and his family were relocated from Los Angeles to the Rohwer Relocation Center in Arkansas  and later  as the war was ending they were moved to a camp at Tule Lake in Northern California. Takei's first-hand knowledge of the unjust internment of 120 000 Japanese Americans in World War II  poignantly chronicled in his autobiography  created a lifelong interest in politics and community affairs.After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1956  George studied architecture at UC Berkeley. An ad in a Japanese community paper led to a summer job on the MGM lot dubbing eight characters from Japanese into English for Rodan il mostro alato (1956) (aka "Rodan"). With the acting bug kindled in him  he transferred to UCLA as a theater arts major. Contacting an agent he had met at MGM led to Takei's appearance as an embittered soldier in postwar Japan in the Playhouse 90 (1956) production "Made in Japan" even before starting classes at UCLA. Being spotted in a UCLA theater production by a Warner Bros. casting director led to George's feature film debut in Lo zar dell'Alaska (1960)  various roles in Hawaiian Eye (1959) and other feature work. In June 1960  he completed his degree at UCLA and studied that summer at the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-Upon-Avon in England.After starting a Master's degree program at UCLA  George was cast in the socially relevant stage musical production  "Fly Blackbird!" but was replaced when the show moved to New York. He took odd jobs until returning to his role at the end of the run. Getting little work in Manhattan  George returned to Los Angeles to continue his studies at UCLA  once again appearing in television series and feature films. He earned his Master's degree in 1964. Wanting a multi-racial crew  Gene Roddenberry cast him in "Where No Man Has Gone Before"  the second Star Trek (1966) pilot. Mr. Sulu remained as a regular character when the series went into production. In the hiatus after the end of shooting the first season  he worked on Berretti verdi (1968)  playing a South Vietnamese Special Forces officer.After Star Trek (1966) was cancelled  Takei did guest stints in several television series  voiced Sulu for the animated Star Trek series and regularly appeared at Star Trek conventions. He also produced and hosted a public affairs show  "Expression East/West" aired in Los Angeles from 1971 to 1973. In 1973  he ran for the Los Angeles City Council. Although he lost by a small margin  Mayor Tom Bradley appointed him to the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District  where he served until 1984 and contributed to plans for the subway. During this period  he co-wrote a sci-fi novel  "Mirror Friend  Mirror Foe". He campaigned to get more respect for his character in the Star Trek features  resulting in Sulu finally obtaining the rank of captain in Rotta verso l'ignoto (1991)  a role reprised in the Star Trek: Voyager (1995) episode "Flashback".George has run several marathons and was in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Torch Relay.

nm0001809,Jay Underwood,Jay Deland Underwood,178,From his breakout role in "The Boy Who Could Fly to 'Sonny Bono' in "The Sonny and Cher Story" to appearances at the Sundance Film Festival  Jay Underwood has enjoyed a career of much diversity both in the parts he's played and the mediums he's played in.Underwood began his theatrical pursuits while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area and then went to a performing arts high school in Minneapolis  Minnesota. It was there that Underwood received his "big break" into the movie business when he was chosen from a national casting search to play opposite Annabeth Gish  and Jon Voight in executive producer Robert Redford's "Desert Bloom." From there he moved to 'tinseltown' where  for over 20 years  he made his living as a working actor.Underwood's film credits include three Sundance Film Festival participants "Dancing in September"  "Valerie Flake"  and "Possums." Other highlights are Billy Graham's "Road to Redemption"  Alan Rudolph's "Afterglow"  the Roger Corman cult classic "The Fantastic Four" (as Johnny Storm  The Human Torch)  'Bug' in "Uncle Buck " with John Candy  and Underwood's personal favorite  the title character in "The Boy Who Could Fly."On the small screen Underwood had the incredible opportunity of portraying 'Sonny Bono' in "The Sonny and Cher Story" for ABC. He also is remembered for that lovable android 'Chip' in the Disney Channel trilogy "Not Quite Human". Other favorites would include young 'Ernest Hemingway' in "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles " the mini-series "Blind Faith" with Robert Urich and "Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone" with the original marshal himself  Hugh O'Brien.

nm0001822,Robert Wagner,Robert John Wagner,180,Robert John Wagner Jr. was born on February 10  1930 in Detroit  Michigan  to Thelma Hazel Alvera (Boe)  a telephone operator  and Robert John Wagner Sr.  a traveling salesman. His paternal grandparents were German and his maternal grandparents were Norwegian. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was seven. Always wanting to be an actor  he held a variety of jobs while pursuing his goal  but it was while dining with his parents at a restaurant in Beverly Hills that he was "discovered" by a talent scout. After making his uncredited screen debut in The Happy Years (1950)  Wagner was signed by 20th Century Fox  which carefully built him up toward stardom. He played romantic leads with ease  but this was not until he essayed the two-scene role of a shell-shocked war veteran in La dominatrice del destino (1952) that studio executives recognized his potential as a dramatic actor.He went on to play the title roles in Il principe coraggioso (1954) and La vera storia di Jess il bandito (1957)  and portrayed a cold-blooded murderer in Giovani senza domani (1956). However  his film career skidded to a stop in the mid-'60s after La pantera rosa (1963). Several years of unemployment followed before Wagner made a respectable transition to television as star of the lighthearted espionage series Operazione ladro (1968) (1968-1970). He also starred on the police series Switch (1975)  but Wagner's greatest success was opposite Stefanie Powers on the internationally popular Cuore e batticuore (1979)  which ran from 1979-1984 and has since been sporadically revived in TV-movie form (the series Lime Street (1985) was quickly canceled due to the tragic death of Wagner's young co-star  Samantha Smith).Considered one of Hollywood's nicest citizens  Robert Wagner has continued to successfully pursue a leading man career; he has also launched a latter-day stage career  touring with Stefanie Powers in the readers' theater presentation "Love Letters". He found success playing Number Two  a henchman to Dr. Evil in the blockbuster trilogy Austin Powers - Il controspione (1997)  Austin Powers - La spia che ci provava (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002)  and in 2007  he began playing Teddy Leopold  a recurring role on the CBS sitcom Due uomini e mezzo (2003).,1930-02-10,Detroit  Michigan  USA,,,2,2
nm0001823,Tom Waits,Thomas Alan Waits,180,Thomas Alan Waits was born in Pomona  California  to schoolteachers Alma Fern (Johnson) and Jesse Frank Waits. Described as one of the last beatniks of the contemporary music  Waits in fact has two separate careers. From 1973 (LP "Closing Time") to 1983 ("One From The Heart" soundtrack)  he recorded nine LPs for Asylum Records  writing songs mainly in the manner of Tin Pan Alley  mixing them with jazz and blues. Extraordinarily  he never produced a hit  but he earned a cult following all over the world. In 1983 he signed with Island Records  and released a series of albums that stunned the music world. Beginning with "Swordfishtrombones"  he introduced a whole new orchestration  which included some of the instruments invented by Harry Partch. He found a new ground for his innovations  searching in sound fields that never before were searched. This second part of his career coincided with his marriage to Kathleen Brennan  a former writer for Francis Ford Coppola (Zoetrope (1999)). His LPs "Rain Dogs" (1985)  "Big Time" (soundtrack) and "The Black Rider" are today what Kurt Weill's music was once.

nm0001834,Damon Wayans,Damon Kyle Wayans,188,A tall (6'2")  sly  cueball-domed comedian of film and television satire  Damon Wayans hit outrageous 90's TV stardom playing various wise guys and streetwise slick characters on older brother Keenen Ivory Wayans' landmark  black-oriented TV sketch comedy In Living Color (1990). The show was pretty much a family act and it made Damon a breakout comedy star. This  in turn  would lead to many of his own popular film comedy vehicles.Born on September 4  1960  in New York City  Wayans was the third of ten children of Elvira Alethia (Green)  a social worker and singer  and Howell Wayans  a supermarket manager. The children grew up humbly in the Fulton Housing Projects and Damon began zeroing in on his innate comedic skills while still a child by conjuring up weird characters. Ostracized by other children due to a severe physical disability (club foot)  humor played a strong part in helping Damon handle a severely painful and debilitating childhood. He wore leg braces  orthopedic shoes and endured numerous surgeries before the affliction could be corrected.Dropping out of high school in the ninth grade  he worked various jobs (mail clerk  etc.) until following older brother Keenen out to Hollywood to seek comedy fame and fortune. Doing the typical L.A. stand-up scene starting in 1982  he toured on the national comedy club circuits until earning a regular featured slot on Il Saturday Night Live (1975) for one season (1985-1986). On the big screen  he nabbed a few bit parts in films that showcased Hollywood's top comedians  including Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop - Un piedipiatti a Beverly Hills (1984)  his movie debut  and Steve Martin in Roxanne (1987). He also appeared briefly in brother Keenen's film spoofs Hollywood Shuffle (1987) and Scappa  scappa... poi ti prendo! (1988).Damon gained major notice as an alien alongside Jeff Goldblum and future co-star Jim Carrey in the wild and woolly film Le ragazze della Terra sono facili (1988)  as well as in various supporting roles that included L'ultima battuta (1988) with Tom Hanks and the grim police drama Colors - colori di guerra (1988) with Sean Penn. Stardom came with TV  however  and his participation in brother Keenan's fast-paced groundbreaking show that truly pushed the limits. It gave Damon a brilliant showcase as both actor and special material writer and he broke out early among the talented ensemble players with his eclectic gallery of characters that often bordered on raunch: Homey the Clown  the disabled Handiman and the outrageously gay film critic Blaine Edwards from the "Men on Film" skits. The talented ensemble would include siblings Kim Wayans  Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans. Creative control and financial issues  especially content censoring  led to Keenan abruptly leaving the show in 1992  followed by Damon and his kin within a year.From there Damon pursued film and TV solo stardom. For the next decade and a half  Damon became his own "Man on Film." He was Bruce Willis' partner in the noticeably violent crime thriller L'ultimo boy scout - Missione: sopravvivere (1991); wrote  executive-produced and starred as a former conman trying to mend his ways in Pioggia di soldi (1992)  which also featured younger brother Marlon Wayans; expanded his "In Living Color" handicapped superhero character Handiman into feature-length form with Un eroe fatto in casa (1994); played an in-your-face drill sergeant in the aptly titled Il maggiore Payne (1995); co-starred with Adam Sandler as a policeman bringing in a petty crook (Adam Sandler) in the action comedy Bulletproof (1996); joined in the basketball-themed Celtic Pride (1996); and stretched his acting muscles in Spike Lee's comedy-drama Bamboozled (2000). He was also executive producer on Waynehead (1996)  a Saturday morning animated show based on his childhood that featured the voices of younger siblings Kim Wayans  Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans.Although his strongest suit is still in stand-up (he has starred in several HBO comedy specials)  Damon went back to steady television employment as star and executive producer of the sitcom Tutto in famiglia (2001). Following the demise of that series  he also wrote  produced  directed and starred in the dramatic film Behind the Smile (2006) in which he played a green Cleveland stand-up comic hoping to make it big in Los Angeles. He also attempted to follow brother Keenan by creating  writing and appearing in a TV sketch comedy show entitled The Underground (2006)  which involved second-generation Wayans family. It failed to catch on  however  and was cancelled after 11 episodes.In recent years he has refocused on TV guest work  returning to the series format  however  with a starring role as Detective Roger Murtaugh on the offbeat comedy-drama Lethal Weapon (2016)  based on the film series of the same name. Divorced from his wife Lisa (1984-2000)  he is the father of four  including actor Damon Wayans Jr..,1960-09-04,New York City  New York  USA,,,1,4
nm0001835,Carl Weathers,Carl Weathers,185,Carl Weathers was born on January 14  1948  in New Orleans  Louisiana. A famous and successful football star at San Diego State  he played with the Oakland Raiders and retired from the sport in 1974  in order to give full attention to his goal: to be a real actor. Weathers first played small parts in two blaxploitation flicks  Assassinio all'aeroporto (1975) (in which he played "Yarbro") and Bucktown (1975) (playing "Hambone")  both made in 1975 and directed by Arthur Marks. However  his big break came the following year when producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff chose him to play "Apollo Creed" in the blockbuster "sleeper" Rocky (1976) (real-life boxing legend Ken Norton was originally signed for the part  but it eventually went to Weathers). He went on to play "Creed" in three other "Rocky" movies  and the characters' adversarial relationship eventually evolved into a warm friendship. After Creed's death in Rocky IV (1985)  Weathers met with producer Joel Silver and agreed to play an important supporting role in Predator (1987)  an action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year  Silver produced Action Jackson (1988)  a first starring role for Weathers  but it performed poorly at the box office and was panned by the critics. During the 1990s  Weathers starred in four L'ispettore Tibbs (1988) two-hour TV specials that were much better received by critics and viewers alike. In 1996  he played the part of "Chubbs Peterson" in the blockbuster Adam Sandler comedy Un tipo imprevedibile (1996). He returned to his "action roots" in two TV-movies with Hulk Hogan: Assalto all'isola del diavolo (1997) and Assalto alla montagna della morte (1999). In addition to his acting career  Weathers is also a member of the Big Brothers Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee  handling the career of athletes of various sports such as gymnastics  wrestling  swimming and judo.,1948-01-14,New Orleans  Louisiana  USA,,,3,2

nm0001839,Tuesday Weld,Susan Ker Weld,161,Susan Ker Weld was born on August 27  1943 (Friday)  in New York City. When her father  Lathrop Motley Weld  died three years later at the age of 49  the young girl  whose name by then had somehow been transmogrified into "Tuesday"  took over the role of the family breadwinner  which included her mother Yosene Balfour Ker. She became a successful child model  posing for advertisements and mail-order catalogs. Her work and the burden of responsibility estranged her from her mother Yosene  her two elder siblings  and forced the preteen girl into adulthood. At nine years of age  she suffered a nervous breakdown; at ten  she started heavy drinking; one year later  older men started exploiting her  all of which led to a suicide attempt at age twelve. In 1956 she debuted in the low-budget exploitation movie Il re del rock and roll (1956) and decided to become an actress. After numerous TV appearances in New York she went to Hollywood in 1958 and was cast for Missili in giardino (1958)  something of a breakthrough for her. Over the next few years Tuesday became Hollywood's queen of teen  playing mainly precocious sex kittens. Her wild private life added to the entertainment of her fans. Critics acknowledged her talent  directors approved of her professionalism  and in the late 1960s she even managed to grow out of her child/woman image and find more demanding roles - she had been "sweet little 16" for about 16 years. However  Tuesday Weld didn't achieve first-magnitude stardom. Maybe she was just unlucky with her selection of jobs (she turned down Lolita (1962)  Gangster Story (1967)  Il Grinta (1969)  Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969)  among others); maybe her independence-loving mind made her instinctively shrink back from the restraints of super stardom. In any case  she kept on performing well in films that had either not much flair or not much success. From the mid-'70s on she focused more and more on made-for-TV movies  which was ironic in that the best (C'era una volta in America (1984)) and the most successful (Un giorno di ordinaria follia (1993)) films that came her way happened after her big-screen career had pretty much petered out.,1943-08-27,New York City  New York  USA,,,3,2

She made her film debut in 1980  but did not make a name for herself until her performance as Emma  a prostitute during the 1930s Depression  in Woody Allen's La rosa purpurea del Cairo (1985). Allen was so impressed by Wiest's acting ability that he has directed her on four more occasions since.

Arguably her most beloved role came as Peg Boggs  the kindly Avon Lady who discovers the titular Edward mani di forbice (1990). Wiest returned to Woody Allen for Pallottole su Broadway (1994)  a superb comedy film set in 1920s New York  winning her second Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her magnificent portrayal of Helen Sinclair  a boozy  glamorous and neurotic star of the stage  who could made the words "Don't speak!" the funniest sentence ever captured on film. Recently enjoying great success with witchy roles in the comedy film Amori & incantesimi (1998) and the television miniseries Il magico mondo delle favole (2000)  Dianne Wiest lives in New York City with her two adopted daughters  Emily and Lily.,1948-03-28,Kansas City  Missouri  USA,,,0,0

Her father encouraged her early interest in theater during high school.She made her professional debut at age 18 in a Houston-based musical production  then studied at Brown University in Providence  Rhode Island  with the intentions of becoming a child psychologist.

Nelson. Officially in the big leagues now  she joined the star ensemble cast of Il grande freddo (1983)  and appeared opposite Nick Nolte in Teachers (1984). Disappointing outcomes in the lackluster sequel Poltergeist II - L'altra dimensione (1986) and the intriguing but overlooked American Dreamer (1984) prodded her to search for more challenging work on TV.It is the small screen  in fact  that has particularly shown off the range of Jobeth's talent over the years  particularly in domestic drama.

nm0001857,Henry Winkler,Henry Franklin Winkler,168,Henry Franklin Winkler was born on October 30  1945  in Manhattan  New York. His parents  Ilse Anna Maria (Hadra) and Harry Irving Winkler  were German Jewish immigrants who escaped the Holocaust by moving to the US in 1939. His father was the president of an international lumber company while his mother worked alongside his father. Winkler is a cousin of Richard Belzer.Winkler grew up with "a high level of low self-esteem." Throughout elementary school and high school  he struggled with academics. This was due to what he would later identify as dyslexia. His parents expected him to eventually work with them at the lumber company. However  he had other plans as he saw roles on stage as the key to his happiness. Winkler's acting debut came in the eighth grade when he played the role of Billy Budd in the school play of the same name. Following his graduation from McBurney High School  Winkler was able to incorporate his learning disability and succeed in higher education. He received a Bachelor's degree from Emerson College in 1967 and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Yale School of Drama in 1970. He later received an honorary PhD in Hebrew Literature in 1978 from Emerson College.Following college  his top priority was to become an actor. However  if this was unsuccessful  he wanted to become a child psychologist because of his deep interest in working with children. Like many other actors  he began his career by appearing in 30 commercials. His first major film role was in Happy Days - La banda dei fiori di pesco (1974) in which he played a member of a Brooklyn gang. After that  he was cast on a new ABC series which was set in the 1950s  Happy Days (1974). He was given the role of high school dropout and greaser Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli. The character was seldom seen during the first few episodes as ABC initially feared he would be perceived as a hoodlum. However  the character became extremely popular with viewers  and the show's producers decided to give Fonzie a more prominent role in the series.Following this  the show's ratings began to soar  and Fonzie became a 1970s icon and the epitome of cool. His motorcycle  leather jacket  thumbs-up gesture  and uttering of the phrase "Aayyyy!" became television trademarks. Unlike many other 1970s stars who rose to fame in a short period of time and developed "big heads"  Winkler managed to stay well grounded and avoided falling into this trap. He was said to be more polite and agreeable  even after his popularity soared. He remained on the series until its cancellation in 1984.In the mid-1980s  with his Happy Days (1974) now behind him  Winkler decided to change his focus toward producing and directing. He produced and directed several television shows and movies  most notably MacGyver (1985) and Sabrina  vita da strega (1996). In the mid-1990s and early 2000s  he was able to re-establish himself with a younger generation of moviegoers and TV viewers  appearing in the popular films  Scream (1996) and Waterboy (1998) and on shows such as The Practice - Professione avvocati (1997) and Arrested Development - Ti presento i miei (2003).In 2018 after over 45 years in the entertainment industry  he won his first ever Prime Time Emmy Award: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role on the HBO series Barry (2018). In addition to his movie and film credits  Winkler is a well accomplished author. Between 2003 and 2007  he co-authored 12 children's novels with Lin Oliver. The series is called "Hank Zipzer  the World's Greatest Underachiever." The books are based on his early struggles with dyslexia  and they sold more than two million books in that time.Winkler has been married since 1978 to Stacey Winkler (nee Weitzman) with whom he has three children. Together  they are actively involved with various children's charities. In 1990  they co-founded the Children's Action Network (CAN)  which provides free immunization to over 200 000 children. Winkler is also involved with the Annual Cerebral Palsy Telethon  the Epilepsy Foundation of America  the annual Toys for Tots campaign  the National Committee for Arts for the Handicapped  and the Special Olympics.In September 2003  Winkler suffered a personal setback when John Ritter  unexpectedly passed away.

Then came Codice d'onore (1992) followed by another dry spell in which a return to restaurant work looked like a good option. Television shows seemed possible but Noah steered clear of these because of the 5-year contract commitment. Then came the script for the pilot of E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994)  and the part of Dr. Carter looked very good.

After parlaying this success into The Kentucky Fried Movie  the three conceived the idea that would create a whole new film genre. Airplane! (1980) broke all conventions  featuring dramatic actors like Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen performing zany jokes with straight-laced sincerity. The spoof became the surprise hit of 1980  beginning a streak of hilarious movies including Top Secret! (1984) and Ruthless People (1986)  after which David branched out on his own to direct The Naked Guns (1988  1991  1994)  BASEketball (1998)  Scary Movies 3 (2003)  and 4 (2006)  and others.David also found time to produce the successful  but somewhat less hilarious A Walk in The Clouds (1995) and Phone Booth (2002)  and recently completed a feature script  The Star of Malta  a comedy set in the Film Noir era  and an international spy thriller  "Counter Intellijence!".Outside of the entertainment world  David has been a prominent advocate of environmental causes  having served on the board of TreePeople  an LA based organization committed to promoting community based tree planting and ecological solutions.

nm0001881,Maryam d'Abo,Maryam d'Abo,169,Born in London  England and raised in European cities such as Paris and Geneva  Maryam d'Abo has rewarded audiences with her beauty and presence for over twenty years. Maryam first appeared in Xtro  attacco alla Terra (1982)  a gory horror film that is considered a cult entry in the genre. She appeared consistently throughout the mid-1980s in a variety of films  including two mini-series based on novels of author Sidney Sheldon: La padrona del gioco (1984) and If Tomorrow Comes (1986). She accepted "Laughter in the Dark" based on the Vladimir Nabokov novel. Her co-stars were Maximilian Schell and Mick Jagger. She thought it would be her big break  since it was a very challenging role  and she was in every scene. But financing fell through  and the film was never completed. The stress made her lose weight  and she appeared more mature. Which turned out to be just the right look for a classical cellist in her next film. Thus  her real big break came in the form of the James Bond film  007 - Zona pericolo (1987). Maryam played Bond girl "Kara Milovy"  opposite Timothy Dalton's "James Bond". The film gave her career a real jolt  and she found herself in leading roles throughout the early 1990s  in a variety of films. She based herself in both England and the USA  appearing in Shootfighter - Scontro mortale (1993) and the European horror movie Immortal Sins (1991). She played her hand in the erotic thriller genre  appearing in Tomcat: Dangerous Desires (1993)  Una calda notte ai tropici (1993) and an episode of Red Shoe Diaries (1992)  featured on the video [error]. She starred in more films throughout the mid-1990s  opposite the late Margaux Hemingway in Double Obsession (1992)  a remake: I ricordi di Abbey (1994)  a romantic comedy called Un single per due (1994)  and thrillers such as Timelock (1996) and Contatti scandalosi (1997).In 2002  Maryam drew on her experiences as a Bond Girl to write  produce and host Bond Girls Are Forever (2002)  examining the culture and connotations of being a Bond girl  and the subsequent effects on a film career. This interesting documentary shed new light on the topic of James Bond films  and appeared on British and American television  whilst gaining a DVD release. Maryam strayed away from commercial features  opting to appear in a variety of television dramas  including: a TV mini series of Zivago (2002) and Helen of Troy (2003). More recently  she appeared in San Antonio (2004)  Trespassing (2004)  a movie filmed in France L'enfer (2005) and a direct-to-video sequel  Un principe tutto mio 2: Un matrimonio da favola (2006).

nm0001885,Lars von Trier,Lars Trier,170,Probably the most ambitious and visually distinctive filmmaker to emerge from Denmark since Carl Theodor Dreyer over 60 years earlier  Lars von Trier studied film at the Danish Film School and attracted international attention with his very first feature  L'elemento del crimine (1984). A highly distinctive blend of film noir and German Expressionism with stylistic nods to Dreyer  Andrei Tarkovsky and Orson Welles  its combination of yellow-tinted monochrome cinematography (pierced by shafts of blue light) and doom-haunted atmosphere made it an unforgettable visual experience. His subsequent features Epidemic (1987) and Europa (1991) have been equally ambitious both thematically and visually  though his international fame is most likely to be based on Il regno (1994)  a TV soap opera blending hospital drama  ghost story and I segreti di Twin Peaks (1990)-style surrealism that was so successful in Denmark that it was released internationally as a 280-minute theatrical feature.,1956-04-30,Copenhagen  Denmark,,,1,4

nm0001895,Glenn Miller,Alton Glenn Miller,,Alton Glenn Miller was born on March 1  1904  in Clarinda  Iowa; the son of Lewis Elmer and Mattie Lou Cavender Miller. He started his music studies when his father gave him a mandolin. He soon traded the mandolin for an old horn. In 1916 he switched to trombone. In 1923  he enrolled in the University of Colorado  but after a year  he dropped out of school and moved to Los Angeles  where he joined Ben Pollack's band. He spent most of his time playing gigs and attending auditions.In 1928  Miller moved to New York  where he played session gigs and made orchestrations. At that time he studied with the Russian musician and mathematician Joseph Schillinger  whose star apprentice was George Gershwin. Miller took Schillinger's instruction on orchestration of a practice exercise  which he developed into the song "Moonlight Serenade"  making a small fortune with it. In 1934  Miller joined the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra for a year  then organized an American band for Ray Noble  and made his debut at the Rainbow Room in New York's Rockefeller Center. The special sound of his band was developed in Miller's orchestration by using the "crystal chorus" and other inventive ways of arrangement.Miller recorded his own band first time for Columbia Records on April 25  1935. His instrumental "Solo Hop" reached the Top Ten in 1935  but he did not organize an orchestra under his own name until March of 1937. That band ultimately failed  and in 1938 he reorganized with many different musicians. In 1939  Miller and his new band got an engagement at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle  NY  which was a major spot with a radio wire. In 1939  he scored seventeen Top Ten hits  including such songs  as "Sunrise Serenade"  "Moonlight Serenade"  "Stairway to the Stars"  "Moon Love"  "Over the Rainbow"  "Blue Orchids"  "The Man With the Mandolin"  and other popular songs  which he composed or orchestrated. Miller scored 31 Top Ten hits in the year 1940  and another 11 Top Ten hits in 1941.His number one hits included "Song of the Volga Boatmen"  "You and I"  "Chattanooga Choo Choo"  from his first film  'Sun Valley Serenade'. Miller worked with the vocalists Tex Beneke  Ray Eberle  and the Modernaires with Paula Kelly. On February 10  1942  Miller was presented with the first ever "Gold record" for "Chattanooga Choo Choo" and scored another 11 Top Ten hits in 1942. That was the first full year of his country's participation in the Second World War.Although he was well beyond draft age Miller still strongly wanted to use his talents to help the war effort. After being turned down for a Navy commission he applied to the Army and was accepted with the rank of Captain. On September 27  1942 he gave his last performance as a civilian. The Army assigned him to the Army Air Forces at Yale University in New Haven  Connecticut. He first organized a marching band  then built a large dance band with over two dozen jazz players and 21 string musicians. From January 1943 to June 1944 the Glenn Miller AAF Band made hundreds of live performances  "I Sustain the Wings" radio broadcasts  while previously-unreleased recordings by the former civilian band scored another 10 Top Ten hits in the year 1943. Miller took his band to Britain in June 1944. There he performed for the allied troops and did radio shows. His last recording of 20 new songs was made weeks before his death; it was released only in 1995.After the liberation of France  now-Major Glenn Miller wanted to bring his music closer to the troops serving on the Continent and arranged to have the band transferred to Paris. He planned to travel ahead of time to prepare for the full orchestra's arrival but bad weather delayed his flight. On December 15  1944 he accepted an invitation from another officer who was going to Paris on what turned out to be an unauthorized flight. He apparently was unaware that the plane's pilot was inexperienced in winter flying  and more tragically  that the small UC-64 "Norseman" transport had been suffering from fuel-system problems.The plane never arrived in Paris  and on December 24  1944 the AAF officially reported it and its crew as MIA (Missing in Action)  under the presumption that it had gone down in the English Channel. In 1985  the British Ministry of Defence came up with explanation of Miller's disappearance  claiming that his plane was struck by a British bomb dropped in the waters by returning RAF pilots. Subsequent research has given credence to the alternate hypothesis that the plane crashed due to icing of its fuel system in the cold air over the Channel. However no wreckage  remains  or IDs have ever been found  precluding any definitive explanation. Glenn Miller was eventually officially declared dead; at his daughter's request a memorial tombstone was placed in Memorial Section H  Number 464-A on Wilson Drive in Arlington National Cemetery in April of 1992 ,1904-03-01,Clarinda  Iowa  USA,1944-12-15,,0,2

First in L'odio (1995)  the young actor  actually coming from upper classes  succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation  (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group).

nm0002002,Shin'ichi Chiba,Sadaho Maeda,179,Pivotal figure in the 1970s explosion of martial arts cinema as lethal "fists for hire" trouble shooter  Takuma (Terry) Tsurugi  starring in the phenomenally popular and ultra violent "The Street Fighter" series of action films. Sonny Chiba wasn't a graceful  fluid fighter like screen icon Bruce Lee  but rather he was a ferocious machine that mowed down his opponents with his fists and feet  always with a menacing grimace on his face!Chiba was born Sadao Maeda in Fukuoka  Japan in 1939 and shared a house along with four other siblings to a father who was a military test pilot. As a youth  he was keen on both theatre and gymnastics  and was a talented enough athlete to score a position in the Japanese Olympic Team  until a chronic back injury finished his gymnastic aspirations. However  whilst at university he took a strong interest in karate under the guidance of the legendary "Mas Oyama"  and soon earned his first black belt. However  his life took another turn  when in 1960 he was discovered during a talent search by Toei Studios  and he soon began his screen career under the name of "Shinichi Chiba"  appearing as "Space Chief" in _Uchu Kaisoku-ken (1961)_ (aka "Invasion of the Neptune Men). Over the next decade  Chiba busied himself with many appearances in Japanese crime thrillers and steadily built a reputation for playing hard men of few words and direct actions.With his martial arts proficiency in karate  judo & kenpo  he was in the box seat to take advantage of the early 1970s martial arts boom commenced by Chinese superstar Bruce Lee  and Chiba starred in the brutal and uncompromising Gekitotsu! Satsujin ken (1974) (aka "The Streetfighter"). The film has Chiba playing a mercenary style  street thug who will do anything for a price  and take on most anyone  including the Japanese Yakuza. The approach of the film was quite different from the Bruce Lee films in that Lee only eliminated his enemies when he was defending his friends or his honor. Quite the opposite  Chiba was only after a fistful of dollars for his deadly services and would engage in mortal combat for the highest bidder  although this often clouded his judgement to his own detriment. The only person "The Street Fighter" respects is his martial arts teacher  the short rotund  karate master "Masaoko" played by Masafumi Suzuki  who manages to easily out smart and out fight the frustrated Chiba! Upon its release  the film was roundly criticised for its excessive violence  including the amazing finale where a lethal blow to the ringleader's skull is shown in x-ray on screen. Fans didn't care  and they flocked in their thousands to see this economically made  yet eye catching chop socky spectacular.A sequel quickly followed with him back again in the messy production Satsujin ken 2 (1974) (aka "Return of The Streetfighter")  which was followed by a third Streetfighter movie also starring female martial arts dynamo Etsuko Shihomi in the gritty I 2 che spezzarono il racket (1974) (aka "Sister Street Fighter")  and then the fourth and final film in the series _Gyakushu Satsujin ken (1974)_ (aka "The Street Fighters Last Revenge")  which was arguably the best of all the sequels.Chiba had firmly established himself as a key anti-hero of Asian martial arts cinema who said little  and used his fists to sort out his troubles. With the demand high from keen action fans  he remained remarkably busy on screen for the next twenty years starring in numerous Japanese film & TV productions with an emphasis on bruising fights  samurai swords  Yakuza gangsters and pretty girls in trouble.Outside of Japan  the "Street Fighter" series of films has achieved enduring popularity through many midnight cult screenings  and their style heavily influenced a youthful indie filmaker named Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino has used strong references and imagery from the "Street Fighter" movies in several of his films including Una vita al massimo (1993) and _Pulp Fiction (1995)_. And when Tarantino came around to casting his mammoth Kill Bill - Volume 1 (2003) project  he was awed to have Chiba accept the key role of the hot headed  and sometimes humourous  Okinawan sword maker "Hattori Hanzo. Sonny Chiba has undoubtedly been a major figure and ongoing influence in the worldwide passion for martial arts movies for over thirty years  and he continues to actively contribute to the genre by encouraging & training young hopefuls seeking to make their mark on screen.,1939-01-23,Fukuoka  Japan,,,2,3

nm0002008,Eric Clapton,Eric Patrick Clapton,182,Eric Clapton was born in Ripley  Surrey  England  on March 30  1945. His real father was a Canadian pilot but he didn't find that out until he was 53. When he was 2 his mother felt she was unable to look after him  so Eric then went to live with his grandparents. When he was 14 he took up the guitar  having been influenced by blues artists such as B.B King  Buddy Guy  Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker.In 1963  after he was chucked out of art college  he joined Paul Samwell-Smith  as he was in art school with Keith Relf. He stayed for about 18 months before beginning a stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Eric became known as "god"  as he impressed the whole English music scene with his amazing guitar playing.After about a year Eric had had enough of impersonating his blues idols and decided to form a group of his own  so in 1966 he formed a band with bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker (who had the idea) that became known as Cream. This band was not a purist blues group but a hard-driving rock and blues trio. They first performed together at a jazz and blues festival in Surrey before signing a record contract. In November 1966 their debut single  "Wrapping Paper"  hit UK #34  but their next single  "I Feel Free"  made more of an impression  hitting UK #11 the following January. At the same time they released their debut album "Fresh Cream"  which was a top-ten hit  going to UK #6 and went on to make US #39 later in the year.Cream spent most of 1967 either touring or writing  recording and producing "Disreali Gears"  which was to be one of their finest efforts. The first single that confirmed the group as a mainstream success was "Strange Brew"  which went to #17 in the UK. After a hectic worldwide tour  their second album "Disreali Gears" was released and became an enormous worldwide hit  rising to UK #5 and US #4. The album's success r4esulted in one of its tracks  "Sunshine Of Your Love"  a hit in the US  going to #36. In February 1968 Cream set out on a six-month US tour  the longest time that a British band ad ever been in America. The tour took in hundreds of theaters  arenas and stadiums  but in April 1968 the band was exhausted and decided to take a short break from touring. However  during their break disaster struck. While Cream was in America Eric had given an interview to the magazine "Rolling Stone" which had Eric the editor make critical points about his guitar playing. This led to an eruption within the band  which was the beginning of the end. Despite this setback  the band's US tour carried on until June  during which they had been recording their most popular project  "Wheels Of Fire"  a double album that was released in August 1968; the live album shot to UK #3 and the studio effort to UK #7  but both went directly to US #1 for four weeks. Despite the fact that the band had sold so many records  had sold out nearly every concert  had made millions and even managed to boost "Sunshine Of Your Love" to hit US #5 and UK #25  they decided that after a farewell tour of America Cream would split. The band toured North America in October  played two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London in November and then Cream was no more - as Clapton explained  "The Cream has lost direction."In the winter of 1969 Eric began jamming with former Traffic front man Steve Winwood  with Ginger Baker also joining in Eric's mansion in Surrey. With bassist Ric Grech added to the lineup  the band became Blind Faith and started rehearsing and recording material. In June 1969  after the band finished a recording session for their first and only album  they made their live debut in Hyde Park to a crowd of over 200 000 fans. Despite the fact that Baker and Grech felt that the concert was a triumph  Clapton and Winwood  however  were more or less convinced that Blind Faith had blown it first time round. However  despite their feelings  Blind Faith set out on a summer sellout tour of the US  playing in arenas and stadiums all over the country. The tour itself earned the band a fortune  but the band members were convinced that the music itself was unsatisfying.After the tour was over their only album  "Blind Faith"  was released  and it topped the charts worldwide. Despite the success of the album and tour Blind Faith still decided to disband  though  and Clapton went on tour with Delaney & Bonnie & Friends  who were Blind Faith's support act on the tour  and also performed at times with The Plastic Ono Band. In March 1970 Eric launched his highly successful solo career  by releasing a first solo album  which featured Delaney & Bonnie.,1945-03-30,Ripley  Surrey  England  UK,,,1,3

nm0002012,Randall 'Tex' Cobb,Randall Hubbard Cobb,191,Former Heavyweight boxing contender Randall "Tex" Cobb has had 3 highly colorful careers; kickboxer  pro boxer  and movie actor. Born in Bridge City  Texas on May 7  1950  the 6 feet 3 inch  225 pound Cobb excelled in high school football and martial arts. Enjoying "extreme" sports to the max  Cobb launched a professional kickboxing career and racked up 9 straight knockout victories. Realizing however  that the big money was in boxing  he switched sports and launched a professional boxing career. Known for a "cast-iron" chin  a sledge-hammer punch  and a "gift for gab"  Cobb quickly established himself as one of the top heavyweight contenders in the world. Cobb's brutal  one-sided beating by heavyweight King Larry Holmes over 15 rounds (Cobb was never off his feet) caused world-famous boxing announcer Howard Cosell to "swear-off" boxing for the rest of his life. Cobb took the beating with his typical grin and a wide smirk. His antics captured the attention of Hollywood and he was cast as Jon Voight's opponent in the remake of Il campione (1979). Cobb went on to act in a vast number of successful productions  receiving positive reviews for his "raw  primitive " acting style. He launched a highly successful ring comeback in the early 1990s stretching his winning streak to 20 straight. However  he retired unexpectedly with a 43-7 log with 36 knockouts  never to box again. He continues to act and has been the subject of a highly-controversial Sport's Illustrated article which resulted in numerous law-suits.,1950-05-07,Bridge City  Texas  USA,,,0,0
nm0002015,Phil Collins,Philip David Charles Collins,168,Phil Collins was born in Chiswick  London  England  to Winifred (Strange)  a theatrical agent  Greville Philip Austin Collins  an insurance agent. He spent most of his early entertainment life as a young actor and model. He played the "Artful Dodger" in the West End production of "Oliver!" alongside the future movie screen "Artful Dodger " Jack Wild. His interest in music and drumming began at school  where he drummed with a stage school band "The Real Thing " subsequently joining "Freehold" and "Flaming Youth." "Flaming Youth" recorded an album to some critical acclaim  although the group disbanded shortly afterward. Collins later successfully auditioned for Genesis  taking over vocals from Peter Gabriel when he left the band in 1975.After separating from his first wife  Collins recorded his first solo album  "Face Value." The album was well received and Collins started to become a household name after the song "In the Air Tonight" was featured on the US TV show Miami Vice (1984). This instigated a guest appearance on the show playing a game show host. His third LP  "No Jacket Required " produced multiple chart hits and awards.Collins is an active musician and entertainer  contributing and guesting regularly on many albums  ranging from Gary Brooker and Camel (Peter Barden's old band) to Eric Clapton. Collins also played as the drummer for the jazz fusion group Brand X and later formed his own big band to play swing and jazz music.Collins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. With over 200 million album sales (when his solo career and Genesis career are combined)  Collins is one of the most successful musicians of all time  as well as probably the most successful British pop star to have been consistently overlooked for the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British music.Actress Lily Collins is his daughter (her mother is his second wife  Jill Tavelman).,1951-01-30,Chiswick  London  England  UK,,,3,5
nm0002018,Tom Conti,Thomas Antonio Conti,180,Preferring contemporary over classical theatre (with nary a Shakespeare stage credit in sight)  one of West End theatre's most enduring and popular faces of the past four decades has been that of Tom Conti.He was born Thomas Antonio Conti on November 22  1941  in Paisley  Scotland  to a pair of hairdressers. His father  Alfonso  was an Italian immigrant  and his mother  Mary (McGoldrick)  was Scottish  though of Irish descent. A student at Hamilton Park Catholic School (for boys)  he initially trained for a musical career as a classical pianist but switched gears while attending the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Conti's acting credits began with the Citizen's Theatre's 1959 production of "The Roving Boy" at age eighteen.Throughout the 1960s he tried to make ends meet on the Glasgow and English repertory stages but gained little momentum despite some scattered TV appearances in between. Unable to find the break to sustain himself  he considered leaving the arts at one point for a steadier career in medicine. While performing in the 1972 play "The Black and White Minstrels" at the Traverse Theatre for the Edinburgh Festival  however  he was spotted and cast in the TV series Adam Smith (1972)  thus beginning a more promising streak of work. He would return to the play in 1974 at the Hampstead Theatre  where he also performed in "Other People" (also 1974) and as the title role of "Don Juan" (1976). An earlier London stage debut in 1973 with the acclaimed Christopher Hampton play "Savages" also helped move things along.Following a number of successful Engish mini-series roles  particularly his slothful Charles Bovary in Madame Bovary (1975)  Jewish novelist Adam Morris in The Glittering Prizes (1976)  and ever-conquesting Norman in "The Norman Conquest" trilogy by Alan Ayckbourn  Tom reaped huge career rewards under the theatre lights starring as a paralyzed sculptor in both the London and Broadway mountings of the right-to-die play "Whose Life is it Anyway?" in 1979. Among the reaps were the Tony  Outer Critics Circle  Laurence Olivier  and Variety Club Awards; among the rewards was a 1980s film career in starring roles. Despite losing out on recreating his "Whose Life..." role on film (Richard Dreyfuss was granted that opportunity in 1981)  Tom absolutely wowed American audiences with his scene-stealing work in Furyo (1983) and Reuben  Reuben (1983). He was given the National Board of Review award for his participation in both films  and earned a "leading actor" Oscar nomination for the latter in which he played an alcoholic Scottish writer. To date  he has not received another Oscar nomination or  arguably  been handed comparative film roles since.Continuing in American films with the lesser-received American Dreamer (1984) and Oddio  ci siamo persi il papa (1986)  he failed to nab what seemed quite inevitable -- Hollywood screen stardom. He did  however  venture off to find other film projects to star or co-star in over the years -- both here and abroad. These have included Shirley Valentine - La mia seconda vita (1989) opposite Pauline Collins  Someone Else's America (1995)  Fuga dall'inferno (1998)  Paid (2006) and A Closed Book (2009) with Daryl Hannah.Not one to frequent pubs himself  he nevertheless earned glowing reviews disappearing into the lives of two notorious celebrity tipplers -- columnist Jeffrey Bernard in "Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell" (1990  2000  2006) and bon vivant actor John Barrymore in "One Helluva Life" (2002) -- in separate one-man stage shows. A writer as well  the versatile Conti published the thriller novel "The Doctor" in 2004. He has long been married to Scottish actress Kara Wilson (since 1967)  who has appeared with him on stage ("Present Laughter" and "The Last of the Red Hot Lovers"  both of which he also directed) as well as TV and film. Daughter Nina is an actress and ventriloquist. The couple maintain residence in London.,1941-11-22,Paisley  Scotland  UK,,,0,1

nm0002032,Roger Daltrey,Roger Harry Daltrey,170,Roger Daltrey is noted as a founder of the legendary rock band The Who. After leaving London's Acton County Grammar School in 1963  he formed a skiffle band called The Detours  then displayed an early genius by putting together unusual elements into a world-class performance. The unusual elements included Daltrey on vocals  John Entwistle on bass and Pete Townshend on lead guitar. In 1965 they added drummer Keith Moon  and the fabulous line-up was complete. The band was remarkable for the synthesis of personalities: Townshend's art-school sensibilities; Daltrey's down-to-earth interpretation; and Entwistle's and Moon's skill as performers. They were first noted for deafening shows and for smashing their instruments in ferocious displays of auto-destructive art  but they went on to considerable chart success through original songs written by Townshend and the more humor-oriented Entwistle. Townshend wrote the first rock mini-opera for their second album  and after their first tour of America  the band presented the full-length rock opus Tommy  which shattered barriers and established The Who as a major artistic force in the world of music. Daltrey released his first solo album in 1973  and followed that with a number of solo chart successes. He also established a stage and (somewhat offbeat) film career after starring in the movie of Tommy (1975). He pursued films more steadily after the death of drummer Moon  and turned to production with the drama McVicar (1980). The band continued to perform sporadically with different drummers and John Bundrick on keyboard  but returned to full force in the 1990s with the addition of Zak Starkey on drums. Though Townshend is noted as the songwriter and lead guitarist of The Who  Daltrey remains the genius who drives their performances. His energy and stage presence established The Who at the monumental Monterey Pop  Woodstock and Isle of Wight music festivals  and his instincts for production carved their path through the era of stadium rock. The filmography of musical performances stand as the best evidence of Daltrey's brilliance as both a musician and a stage performer.,1944-03-01,Hammersmith  London  England  UK,,,1,4

nm0002049,Robert Downey Sr.,Robert John Elias Jr.,191,Robert Downey Sr. served in the army  played minor-league baseball  was a Golden Gloves champion and off-off Broadway playwright  all before he was 22 years old.Downey was born in New York City  New York  the son of Elizabeth (McLoughlin)  a model  and Robert Elias  who worked in hotel/restaurant management. He took the surname of his stepfather  James Downey  when enlisting in the army. His father was of Lithuanian Jewish descent  while his mother was of half Irish and half Hungarian Jewish ancestry. In 1960  he began writing and directing basement-budgeted  absurdist films that gained an underground following: Balls Bluff (1961)  Babo 73 (1964)  Chafed Elbows (1966) and No More Excuses (1968). Putney Swope (1969) was the first Downey-directed film to earn a mainstream release. A devastating satire of Madison Avenue  it explored what happens when an African-American activist is given carte blanche at an advertising agency. The film was among the year's Top 10 Films in New York Magazine. Downey thrived in the laissez-faire film world of the 1970s with such irreverent films as Pound (1970)  where humans play dogs waiting to be adopted. Around this time he worked on projects for Joseph Papp and the New York Public Theatre  directing David Rabe's play "Sticks and Bones" for CBS (Sticks and Bones (1973)). The strong anti-war sentiments expressed in this live broadcast resulted in a major controversy when its sponsors pulled out at the last minute  and the network had to air the film uninterrupted because it couldn't find a sponsor. His Greaser's Palace (1972) is an outrageous restaging of the life of Christ in "spaghetti western" terms. Time Magazine put this film on its list of the year's Top 10 movies. Downey's take-no-prisoners sense of humor is also apparent in Moment to Moment (1975) and Piscine - Incontri a Beverly Hills (1997) (world premiere at the Sundance festival in 1997)  a film that examines a day in the life of a female pool cleaner in Hollywood. Rittenhouse Square (2005) was the feature presentation of the Galway Film Festival and his second teaming with Max L. Raab  having been a consultant on Raab's award-winning Strut! (2001).From time to time Downey acts (badly  according to him) and he can be seen in films such as Boogie Nights - L'altra Hollywood (1997)  Magnolia (1999) and The Family Man (2000). He has appeared twice on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)  The Dick Cavett Show (1968)  IFC's At the Angelika (1997)  Sundance Channel and countless other TV and radio shows. In addition  Downey has been a guest speaker at film festivals and universities throughout the country. He is developing an update of "Putney Swope". He lives in New York City with his wife  Rosemary Rogers.Robert is the father of actors Robert Downey Jr. and Allyson Downey.,1936-06-24,Manhattan  New York City  New York  USA,,,1,2

nm0002101,Robin Givens,Robin Simone Givens,165,Robin Simone Givens was born on November 27  1964 in New York City  to Ruth (Newby) and Reuben Givens. Her father left his family when Robin was a young girl  and she seldom saw him after that. Robin's mother raised her and her younger sister in Westchester  Connecticut. Her mother (once linked to Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield) always encouraged her children's creativity  and helped them develop an interest in the arts. When she was young  Robin began playing the violin but quickly decided it was not for her. She chose instead to channel her artistic energy through acting and  at the age of ten  she started acting classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. In 1980  at fifteen  Robin enrolled as a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College to study pre-med. By her junior year  however  Robin's excitement about the idea of a career in acting intensified and she began taking her craft more seriously. Robin's first experience in Hollywood was on I Robinson (1984)  the hottest show on television. As a result of the role  she and comedian Bill Cosby forged a great friendship which would prove instrumental in Robin's career. She also landed a guest appearance on Il mio amico Arnold (1978). Her career was just about to take off. Robin first made it big in Hollywood in 1986. She took a role in a television movie  La signora di Beverly Hills (1986)  as "April Baxter". But  it was later that year that Robin became a recognizable actress in Hollywood. She was given a role on the television series Segni particolari: genio (1986) as "Darlene Merriman". The series was a comedy about a group of gifted high school students that were placed in an enrichment class. In 1988  Robin married boxing legend Mike Tyson. This union put her into the national spotlight  as Tyson was on the top of his career. He was one of the youngest boxers ever to receive the attention  acclaim and financial success that Tyson garnered. The marriage ended (on Valentine's Day)  just a year later. Rumors hinted at abuse and infidelity. Robin gave marriage another chance in 1997  by marrying her tennis instructor Svetozar Marinkovic. The marriage proved a total failure  as the two were separated since the day they married  and Robin filed for divorce citing "irreconcilable differences". Aside from a successful model and acclaimed actress  Robin is a mother. In October 1999  she gave birth to a baby boy. The baby's father is tennis player Murphy Jensen  but the couple are no longer together. She has another child  and she is raising the two boys today. In 2000  Robin took a controversial career move as she took over for Mother Love on the successful television talk show  Forgive or Forget (1998). Her stint was brief  as just a few months later  the show stopped production. Many point to Mother Love's devoted audience  and the odd dismissal of her from the show she pioneered and created. Robin has tried to forge a friendship with Mother Love  but Love doesn't appear interested. Robin called in during a Howard Stern interview of Mother Love  where she said she was "on her way to work"  which although innocent  proved to upset Mother Love.,1964-11-27,New York City  New York  USA,,,2,0

nm0002150,Billy Idol,William Michael Albert Broad,175,Born William Michael Albert Broad in Middlesex  England  in 1955  the first child of Bill and Joan Broad. When he was 2  his father moved the family to Long Island  New York  in pursuit of the American dream. They returned 4 years later (now with a baby sister  Jane) to Dorking. America made a big impression on Billy; he loved the big cars and rock music. The family moved next to the Running Horses Public House in Mickleham  until 1963  while their home in Goring  Sussex  was being built.The time in Goring would be a happy period for the Broads. Billy enjoyed a fairly normal childhood  hanging out with his pals and getting up to the usual mischief strong-willed boys are wont to. The Broads were a religious family who regularly attended church  Billy joined the Boy Scouts in Goring  though was reputedly asked to leave after getting caught kissing a girl. Idol was a bright student  and passed his 11 plus  but he was bored at school. When a teacher wrote "Billy is Idle" in the margin of one of his works  it stuck in his mind and later inspired his stage name. Nevertheless  Billy progressed well and  when the family moved to Bromley in Kent in 1971  he transferred to the Ravensbourne Grammar School.The distractions of London  however  were not conducive to studying  and he failed to achieve the requirements for university entrance. His disappointed parents arranged for him to retake his exams at Orpington College of further education. Idol enjoyed the more relaxed environment here and  a year later  had secured his place at Sussex University. He began his course in English and Philosophy in September 1975. This coincided with the explosion of punk rock  which captured the imagination of Idol far more than his studies. He started hanging out with a group of like-minded friends at the in-venues in London  instantly recognizable by their Malcolm Mclaren SEX shop clothes and peg pants. They became known as the Bromley Contingent (the contingent included Susan Dallion (Siouxsie Sioux)  later of Siouxsie and the Banshees) and began following the anarchic Sex Pistols to every gig. At this time  Bill Broad changed his name to Billy Idol and decided he wanted to be a real part of the musical revolution. This meant dropping out of university and forming his first band  The Rockettes  with his classmate  Steve Upstone. They played covers of various bands  The Animals  The Beatles and The Doors. They gigged in the campus cafeteria and did one gig outside the University at the local youth hall  though they never recorded. They also did an audition for famed music managers Malcolm McLaren and Bernie Rhodes  who told Steve that he was the real star. This and his father's doubt and disapproval only served to make Billy more determined.When Billy met Tony James  a fellow student  and became Chelsea  then Generation X  they started to get noticed. The final Generation X lineup - Tony James on bass  John Towe on drums  Bob Andrews on guitar and Idol as lead vocals  played their first live show in November 1976 and began writing and recording original material. In 1977  Chrysalis Records offered them a contract. After 3 albums and with management problems  band discord and the decline of the punk movement  Billy decided it was time to go solo. He relocated to New York and hooked up with Kiss manager Bill Aucoin. In 1981  the EP "Don't Stop" (comprising a cover of Tommy James' 1960s hit "Mony Mony" and a pair of remixed Generation X tracks  including "Dancing With Myself") landed him a solo deal with Chrysalis. He found the perfect collaborator and partner in guitarist Steve Stevens and released the self-titled "Billy Idol" in 1982. Idol made full use of the MTV explosion - the hugely successful videos for "White Wedding" and "Dancing With Myself" showcased his peroxide spiky hair  sneer and leathers to great effect. The stage was set for the hugely successful "Rebel Yell" in 1984. These early years were wild with Billy's hell-raising antics generating as much (if not more) publicity than his music. An eight-track best-of  "Vital Idol"  was released in 1985 and the popularity of the live video of "Mony Mony" on MTV kept him in the spotlight. 1986 saw a new release  "Whiplash Smile" - it sold well and saw him nominated for a second Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance (the first was for "Rebel Yell")  but some felt it failed to live up to expectations. Stevens left to form his own band shortly afterwords.Idol was ready to try new things  moving to Los Angeles  taking on a new band and appearing in an all-star stage version of The Who's "Tommy". In 1990  however  around the time of the release of his new album  "Charmed Life"  Idol was involved in a serious motorcycle accident when he ran a stop sign on his Harley. He almost lost a leg and was confined to bed for 6 months. He battled back bravely - the video for the first single  "Cradle of Love"  showed him from the waist up - at the time  he was paralysed below. The album was a success  his fourth in a row to achieve  at least  platinum sales. Idol decided to take a break and try his hand at acting  making his screen debut in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991) in 1991. His next appearances before the camera were less auspicious  after pleading guilty to punching companion Amber Nevel outside a West Hollywood restaurant in 1992. He paid $2700 in fines and was required to appear in a series of anti-drug commercials.The year 1993's "Cyberpunk" saw a new-look Idol  he had changed his famous peroxide spikes to dreadlocks  and his sound to synthesized techo beats. The album flopped  and Idol sank into drug addiction. He had another brush with death in 1994 when he overdosed and had to be treated in a Los Angeles hospital. Upon his discharge  he calmed down and began to focus more on fatherhood. Although he has never married  Idol has two children - a son from his long term relationship with former Hot Gossip Dancer Perri Lister  William Broad  born in June 1988  and a daughter  Bonnie Blue  from another relationship  born 1989. The next few years were quiet until 1998  when a cameo appearance in the hit movie  Prima o poi me lo sposo (1998)  began an Idol revival. In 1999  his recognition was confirmed with his second wax model opening in Las Vegas. He teamed up with Stevens  once more  and found the old magic was still there. A more extensive "Greatest Hits" was released in 2001 and sold over half a million copies in the USA alone  2002 saw two VH1 specials - Behind the Music and Storytellers.Idol is currently working with Stevens on new material  some of which has featured in the most recent tours over the past four years. It may be some time since the hedonistic  hell-raising days but his unbridled passion for music and performing remain and the shows are still no-holds barred. Despite his bad-boy image  offstage Idol is said to be quite gentle and sensitive  knowledgeable with a good sense of humour and vegetarian.,1955-11-30,Stanmore  Middlesex  England  UK,,,0,0

nm0002201,John Debney,John Debney,183,John Debney's career seemed destined for Hollywood  the son of Disney Studios producer Louis Debney  John grew up in nearby Glendale  California where he got early inspiration for film and music growing up on the Disney Studio lot.

Debney earned his B.A. in Music Composition from California Institute of the Arts in 1979  and after four years immersing himself in the business at Disney Studios  Debney made a professional entry into the industry  composing for TV  working with Steven Spielberg and Mike Post on shows such as Star Trek: The Next Generation  Tiny Tunes  and Sea Quest DSV. Debney continued his hands-on training  working with Hanna-Barbera composer Hoyt Curtin  and went on to score major television projects such as which he won an Emmy for Best Main Title.Debney's first big film break came in 1997 with an offer to work on Liar Liar with director Tom Shadyac. With the success of this blockbuster comedy under his belt  Debney went on to work on a variety of different major films including Elf  Iron Man 2  Spy Kids (1 & 2)  and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Debney and Shadyac continued to collaborate  going on to do Bruce Almighty in 2003 and the spinoff Evan Almighty together. In 2005  Debney formed a successful partnership with director Robert Rodriguez  creating scores for his movies Sin City and Machete.Although Debney was widely known within the industry as a versatile and talented composer  the world wouldn't discover him until he composed the landmark score for Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Enticed by the idea of working on a project that held deep  spiritual meaning for him  Debney's score  which blended symphonic orchestra  a wide range of world instruments  and the beauty of the human voice  connected on an emotional level with viewers and listeners  and rose to #1 on Billboard's charts for Soundtrack and Christian Albums  and #19 on the Billboard Top 200. The record was certified gold by the RIAA and won the Dove award for Best Instrumental Album  as well as garnering Debney an Oscar nomination.Shortly after the movie release  Debney premiered "The Passion of the Christ Symphony" in Rome  Italy  a highly successful performance featuring an 83-person choir and a 96-piece orchestra  plus solo musicians and guest vocalists from both the film and the classical worlds  which received a 15-minute standing ovation from the audience. In the tradition of classical composers  John Debney enjoys conducting his own work and has conducted some of the world's greatest orchestras.

Debney credits the success of the movie to the fact that both the film and the score  "Embraced the history" of the original. Long-time collaborator  Jon Favreau and John Debney have worked on a variety of films together including Elf  Zathura  Iron Man 2  and The Jungle Book. Among John Debney's other most recent works are scores for Draft Day  Stoneheart Asylum and History's Emmy-nominated Hatfields & McCoys as well as the History's most recent mini-series Houdini  and A&E mini-series Bonnie & Clyde.Considered one of the most prolific and successful composers in Hollywood  Debney has won 3 Emmy's and been nominated for 7  he is also an Academy Award nominee  and the youngest recipient of ASCAP's prestigious Henry Mancini Lifetime Achievement Award.,1956-08-18,Glendale  California  USA,,,0,0

nm0002240,Katt Shea,Kathleen Ann Shea,,Katt Shea was born in 1957 in Detroit  Michigan. She grew up in a quiet Detroit suburb and graduated from the University of Michigan with honors. Shea worked for a short spell as a teacher in the Detroit public school system. At age 19  Katt drove her Volkswagen to Hollywood  California. She did a fleeting stint as a model and briefly attended UCLA. Shea soon started acting in either small parts or more substantial co-starring roles in such movies as Kiss Games (1983)  Scarface (1983)  Violenza a Hollywood (1984)  La regina dei barbari (1985)  and the superior slasher sequel Psycho III (1986)  making an especially memorable appearance in the latter as one of Norman Bates' victims. Shea made her promising debut as both writer and director with the sexy and stylish thriller Stripped to Kill (1987). She also did the equally solid sequel. Katt's finest cinematic achievement to date was the extremely thoughtful and touching vampire horror gem Dance of the Damned (1989). The gritty drama Streets (1990) and the gripping thriller La mia peggiore amica (1992) were likewise excellent and impressive. Last Exit to Earth (1996) was an entertainingly cheesy sci-fi hoot while the belated and unnecessary sequel Carrie 2: La furia (1999) was regrettably lackluster. Shea also directed a couple of made-for-TV affairs: The poignant and powerful teen drama Sharing the Secret (2000) was a terrific return to form while the humdrum stalker outing Sanctuary (2001) was another unfortunate misstep. After a lengthy absence from the director's chair  Katt made a welcome comeback with Nancy Drew e il passaggio segreto (2019).,1956-10-09,Detroit  Michigan  USA,,,1,0
nm0002245,Tzi Ma,Tzi Ma,170,For more than four decades  Tzi Ma (pronounced "TAI MA") has blazed new trails for the representation of Asian Americans in Hollywood. Celebrated for his uncanny versatility  his body of work encompasses virtually every genre across film  television and theater. From big budget studio pictures like Disney's Mulan and the Rush Hour series to acclaimed independent films like The Farewell and Meditation Park  Ma's unforgettable performances have garnered unanimous critical acclaim and honors throughout his groundbreaking career.Long outspoken on issues of racism and media inclusivity  Ma has been a leading voice for the Asian American community. Despite the limited number of parts for actors of Asian descent during the early part of his career  Ma vehemently refused to perform roles that he considered demeaning or stereotypical. This unwavering stance helped kickstart a newfound consciousness in Hollywood that has transformed the way Asian American characters are portrayed.Born in Hong Kong and raised in Staten Island  Ma worked at a family-owned Chinese restaurant while honing his craft in the New York theater scene. During this period  he worked with then-emerging playwrights David Henry Hwang and Eric Overmyer; who both wrote plays specifically for Ma (The Dance and the Railroad and In Perpetuity Throughout the Universe  respectively).In 1978  Ma made his screen debut alongside Jack Palance and Andy Warhol in the cult classic Cocaine Cowboys directed by Ulli Lommel. Throughout the 1980s  Ma continued to perform in regional and off-Broadway productions while appearing as a guest star on hit television programs like The Cosby Show  The Equalizer  LA Law  MacGyver and Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the 1990s  Ma became a ubiquitous presence on the big screen with supporting roles in such major releases as Robocop 2  Rapid Fire  Chain Reaction  Dante's Peak and Rush Hour.As the new millennium began  Ma balanced a prolific film and television career in which he appeared in over 25 shows between 2000 and 2009  including NYPD Blue  ER  Law & Order and 24. During this time  Ma also began diversifying his roles on the silver screen with a range of unconventional characters. In addition to critically-praised performances in such prestige projects as Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American starring Michael Caine and Joel and Ethan Coen's The Ladykillers starring Tom Hanks  Ma also began appearing in independent features by up-and-coming Asian American and Asian Canadian filmmakers.Throughout the 2010s  Ma had scene-stealing roles in Million Dollar Arm  Arrival and The Farewell as well as recurring parts in major TV shows such as 24: Live Another Day  Hell on Wheels and The Man in the High Castle. He also branched out into voice work with roles on animated shows like American Dad! and video games like Sleeping Dogs. In 2017  the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television nominated Ma for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance as a suspected philandering husband in Mina Shum's acclaimed drama Meditation Park.At the dawn of a new decade  Ma's continues to be in high demand as his career reaches unprecedented new heights. Recently  his performance as a dispassionate father and divorcee in Netflix's Tigertail earned him rave reviews from critics and audiences alike.

nm0002303,Trevor Jones,Trevor Jones,,As a child in Cape Town  Trevor Jones lived opposite the Gem Cinema. The theater was so old and worn out that there was often a loss of the soundtrack  which caused him to realize its power. The fact that everyone in his family worked in film or the theater made it easy to get support in his career choice  but it was the cinema across the street that truly inspired him. At 17  Jones won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music  which his mother was fully behind. Not being from England  he could only stay four years  but he did not wish to return due to lack of industry and South African politics. In his third year  he won an award which brought him to the attention of the BBC  where he worked four years as a classical music reviewer  the time allowing him to become a naturalized British citizen. One day there he met Dr. Wilfrid Mellers  a professor at York Universiy  who helped him design a four-year course plan studying all types of music  from the ethnic to the avant garde  music concrete  and electronic. He then went to the British National Film School for an M.A. in film music  and he learned all aspects of filmmaking  directing  writing  and photographing many student films  and composing the music for most everybody at the university. His education in the field took twelve years.His use of professional musicians allowed him to go straight into the industry. He initially scored shorts with Roger Christian  and was discovered by John Boorman after working on an Irish TV show. Boorman allowed him to write 55 minutes of music for Excalibur (1981) in addition to the classical pieces of Wagner and Orff that were used. Jim Henson called him for Dark Crystal (1982) even before he had a script  and he would work on Henson projects  along with others  until Henson's death. Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work on L'ultimo dei Mohicani (1992). This success makes him frequently on call  particularly when he is in Los Angeles (where his wife and four children like to accompany him)  but he wants to do small  low budget films as well as large  taking small salaries to work on film in which he is really interested. He cites Mark Herman and John Henderson among his favorite directors to work with. He has also worked well with Barbet Schroeder and Richard Loncraine. His attention to the film as an art form is indicative in his work ethic: only one at a time. He once talked himself out of work on a film he thought needed no music. They took his suggestion and won an award. Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei (1984) was a film in which he was brought in very late and did not meet the director or the dubbing mixer. "That was the first and only time on a film that I'd never met the director"  Jones says. Jones tries to keep from becoming typecast  wanting to work on all types of films  and not do films of the same kind all together  when composers are among the most typecast artists in the industry. His style has worked well  as he has had more films in 1997 and 1998 than in any other single year.,1949-03-23,Cape Town  South Africa,,,0,0

nm0002311,Montagu Love,Harry Montague Love,188,Montague Love - certainly an intriguing name - but his own - started his working life as a newspaper man in London. His primary expertise centered on being a field illustrator and cartoonist who covered the Boer War (1899-1902). His realistic battle sketches gained him popularity among readers  but he was bound for a different career. He decided to become an actor. A robust man with a massive head of noble bearing and brooding lower lip  these were ingredients well suited to this goal. Love honed basic stage talents in London  and then made an early departure for the US in 1913 with a road-company production of Cyril Maude's "Grumpy." An early stop was Broadway  and he returned many times to appear in a laundry list of important plays from 1913 to 1934.Silent film studios of the early days were originally based in the East  and Love started his film career at World Studios  New Jersey in 1914. His silent career alone was prodigious-nearly a hundred films. His look and bearing were perfect for authoritative figures. And  though certainly taking on a whole spectrum of roles (sultan  native chiefs  many a doctor and military officer  among many others) he became famous for his bad guy characterizations through the 1920s. Some historians credit him as the best villain of the silent era. In 1926 he was nemesis to Rudolf Valentino in Il figlio dello sceicco (1926) and 'John Barrymore' in Don Juan (1926). The latter movie had the particular fame of sporting the longest sword duel in silent history between Love's Count Giano Donati and Barrymore's Don Juan. The fight filming was unique and realistic with middle and close shots looking directly at the individual combatants-with the appropriate blood in their eyes. The duel was all the more complex choreography for being one with swords and daggers (historically correct but rarely seen in film history). But Love was just as effective as the Roman centurion in The King of Kings (1927) by 'Cecil B DeMille'. Starting with L'albergo delle sorprese (1929)  Love's movies followed the trend of an increasing number of silent films using recorded music and some snatches of dialogue or background sound with the several incipient audio systems. Some movies originally issued as silent were released again with the process added. `Sin' was one of 11 films of 1929 featuring Love given the semi-sound treatment. The last of these was Jules Verne's L'isola misteriosa (1929)  very loosely adapted to the point of being hokey  but one of the first films also using the primitive two-color process.Love had a commanding  puckered-lip British delivery of speech which he could believably weld to any part  but it particularly fit characters of authority  as in the silent era. Into the 1930s  these were increasingly benign rather than despotic-always colonels and generals  prime ministers  American presidents - even Zorro's father. Perhaps his best known character tour de force displaying his genuine acting power was his Henry VIII in Prince and the Pauper (1937). It is hard to forget him in purple as the Bishop of the Black Canons in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Sometimes  as with other veteran character actors  his roles were almost as featured extra-but his very costumed presence was all that was needed to lend realism. A very apt example was his Detchard  noble henchmen to 'Raymond Massey'  in Il prigioniero di Zenda (1937)  in which he has little more than one line. He was still in demand in the early 1940s - ten roles in 1940 alone. But these slowed into the war years. By his passing in 1943  an actor who was considered as noble on screen as off  he had lent his voice as well as virtuoso acting skills to eighty-one additional films.,1880-03-15,Portsmouth  Hampshire  England  UK,1943-05-17,Beverly Hills  Los Angeles  California  USA,1,0

nm0002353,Thomas Newman,Thomas Montgomery Newman,178,Thomas Newman is an American film score composer. He was born in Los Angeles. His father was notable film score composer Alfred Newman (1900-1970). The Newman family is of Russian-Jewish descent  and includes several other well-known musicians. Thomas' mother Martha Louis Montgomery (1920-2005) wanted her sons to have a musical education. Thomas attended regular lessons in violin as a child.

Thomas Newman graduated as Bachelor of Arts in 1977  and a Master of Music in 1978.Thomas originally composed music for theatrical productions in Broadway  working with his mentor Stephen Sondheim. His uncle Lionel Newman asked him to compose music for the television series "The Paper Chase" (1978-1979  1986)  which was Thomas' first credit in a television production.In the 1980s  Thomas first worked in film. Composer John Williams  a close family friend  hired Thomas to work in the music department for space opera film "Return of the Jedi" (1983). Thomas' main work in the film was orchestrating the music in a scene where character Darth Vader dies. Afterwards  Thomas was approached by film producer Scott Rudin and hired to work as a film score composer in his own right. His first work in the field was the film score of romantic drama "Reckless" (1984).While he worked regularly as a film score composer during the 1980s  Thomas reportedly felt he had to retrain himself for a hard and demanding job. It reportedly took him 8 years to not feel fraudulent in his efforts. In 1994  Thomas received his first Academy Award nominations  for the film scores of "The Shawshank Redemption" (1994) and "Little Women" (1994). He lost the Award to rival composer Hans Zimmer  who had been nominated for the film score of the animated film "The Lion King" (1994).Newman was an established and increasingly famous composer in the 1990s.

The main exception being the comedy-drama film "Away We Go" (2009)  which did not have a film score.In the 2000s  Thomas continued working in high-profile films  such as "Road to Perdition" (2002)  "Finding Nemo" (2003)  and "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events". By 2006  he had been nominated eight times for an Academy Award  while never winning it. He started joking about his lack of victories in public.In 2008  Thomas was nominated for two Academy Awards  for both the film score and an original song for the animated film "WALL-E" (2008). He won neither  though the hit song "Down to Earth" earned him a Grammy Award. He continues to work regularly in the 2010s. Among his more acclaimed works were the film scores for spy film "Skyfall" (2012) and period drama "Saving Mr. Banks" (2013). He has continued being nominated for Academy Awards.
